## What it does

Use additional information about factors to speed up Boneh-Durfee.

## Where it lives

- Vendored locally at `vendor/crypto-attacks/attacks/rsa/boneh_durfee.py`
- Upstream: <https://github.com/jvdsn/crypto-attacks/blob/d42a3df980bf/attacks/rsa/boneh_durfee.py>

## Usage

```bash
# read or run it straight from the vendored copy
$EDITOR vendor/crypto-attacks/attacks/rsa/boneh_durfee.py
python3 vendor/crypto-attacks/attacks/rsa/boneh_durfee.py
```

## Code

```python
import logging

from sage.all import RR
from sage.all import ZZ

path = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(os.path.abspath(__file__)))))
if sys.path[1] != path:
