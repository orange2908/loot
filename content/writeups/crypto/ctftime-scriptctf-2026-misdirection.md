![scriptCTF 2026 writeup covering both released challenges — Misdirection is a 115-bit blob that rules out byte decoding by length, splits cleanly into 23 five-bit groups, but only produces meaningful text under Bacon's original 24-letter alphabet where I and J share a symbol and U and V share a symbol, revealing SCRIPTCTFNOTWHATITSEEMS which restores to scriptCTF{notwhatitseems}; and F**K is a 28,786-byte Brainfuck program that hides 31 algebraic byte checks of the form input += C then temp = A times K plus B then input -= temp inside deliberate visual noise, encodes the entire flag in the iteration count of the \[-\] clear loops with no printable success message, ends in a +\[\] infinite loop sentinel, and reveals scriptCTF{t1mm1ng_s1d$_ch@nn31} once the comparison template is recognized and folded](https://cybersecurityelite.com/images/articles/scriptctf-2026-writeup.png)Table of Contents

**scriptCTF 2026** is a two-challenge micro-set that manages to teach the same lesson twice in radically different domains: **the first plausible interpretation of the data is the trap, and the challenge itself tells you so.** Misdirection is 115 bits of ASCII binary — a length that is not divisible by 8 but is divisible by 5, a shape that rules out byte-decoding before you write any code. Fold it into 23 five-bit groups and the “obvious” modern 26-letter Bacon mapping produces plausible-looking gibberish (`RCQIOSCSFMNSUHASISREELR`). Only Bacon’s _original_ 24-letter alphabet — the one where `I/J` and `U/V` share a symbol — collapses those groups into `SCRIPTCTFNOTWHATITSEEMS`. The flag name (_Misdirection_), the hint (_“It is not what it is”_), and the recovered plaintext (`NOT WHAT IT SEEMS`) all point at the same lesson.

F**K, the reverse challenge, does the same thing at 28 kilobytes. The handout is 28,786 bytes of Brainfuck weaponized as visual intimidation — 8,376 `+` instructions, 5,273 `-` instructions, more than seven thousand pointer moves — but the brackets nest only two levels deep, and 395 of the operations survive after algebraic folding. Every check is one shape: `input += C; temp = A * K + B; input -= temp`, exactly zero net residual only when `expected = (A*K + B - C) mod 256`. There is no success message and the program ends on `+[]`, an infinite loop sentinel that hangs on any candidate. The flag is not printed by the program — it is encoded in **how quickly the program reaches that hang** , because `[-]` clears a nonzero cell one decrement at a time. The censored title itself hints at both the language and the “no swearing, so nothing printable” trick.

Handouts, per-challenge READMEs, and pure-stdlib solvers live at [Abdelkad3r/scriptCTF-2026](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/scriptCTF-2026). This **CyberSecurity Elite** scriptCTF 2026 writeup walks both challenges end to end, emphasising the shape-first reasoning that turns each intimidating artifact into an ordinary parsing problem.

## Both challenges at a glance#

Challenge| Category| Points| Author| Flag  
---|---|---|---|---  
Misdirection| Cryptography| 160| NoobMaster| `scriptCTF{notwhatitseems}`  
F**K| Reverse Engineering| 454| Connor Chang| `scriptCTF{t1mm1ng_s1d$_ch@nn31}`  
  
Two challenges, two categories, and one repeated pattern: the intended solve is always one deliberate step _below_ the obvious first attempt. Reading the _shape_ of the data before decoding it wins both.

* * *

## Misdirection — Bacon’s original 24-letter alphabet#

> _Flag:_ `scriptCTF{notwhatitseems}`
> 
> _Hint:_ “It is not what it is.”

The handout is a single line of 115 ASCII binary digits followed by a newline — the smallest possible cryptography artifact, which itself is a signal to read every byte of it carefully.

### Read the shape before the bytes#

Basic triage of `enc.txt`:

```
    $ file challenge/enc.txt
    challenge/enc.txt: ASCII text
    
    $ wc -c -l challenge/enc.txt
           1     116 challenge/enc.txt
    
    $ shasum -a 256 challenge/enc.txt
    2f85d02b187ca89b88b826babbc68c76faf5cfcd080692fed47676d4fb4716ba  challenge/enc.txt
```

Stripping the newline leaves exactly 115 characters, each `0` or `1`:

```
    1000100010100000100001110100100001010010001010110001101100101010000111000001001001000100101000100100001000101110001
```

The instinctive first move on 115 bits is to slice them into bytes. Don’t. Do the modular arithmetic first:

```
    115 mod 8 = 3     ← rules out a byte stream
    115 mod 5 = 0     ← 5-bit groups fit exactly
    115 / 5   = 23    ← 23 symbols
```

The choice of exactly 115 bits, not 112 or 120, is deliberate. Five-bit groups are the characteristic shape of two classical ciphers: telegraph Baudot codes and **Bacon’s cipher**. The 23-symbol length is a reasonable phrase length for a CTF flag body plus wrapper — Baudot’s shift-in / shift-out semantics would need extra symbols for figures. Bacon fits.

### Split into five-bit groups#

Reading left to right:

```
    10001 00010 10000 01000 01110 10010 00010 10010
    00101 01100 01101 10010 10100 00111 00000 10010
    01000 10010 10001 00100 00100 01011 10001
```

Interpret each as a big-endian integer:

```
    17, 2, 16, 8, 14, 18, 2, 18, 5, 12, 13, 18,
    20, 7, 0, 18, 8, 18, 17, 4, 4, 11, 17
```

Every value falls in `[0, 20]`, which is the second confirmation of the shape: a 26-letter alphabet would use indices up to 25, and none appear. The maximum index of 20 is exactly the range of Bacon’s 24-letter table (`0..23`).

### The misdirection#

The natural first attempt is to map `00000..11001` onto `A..Z` with `A = 0`. That produces:

```
    RCQIOSCSFMNSUHASISREELR
```

The result is _all letters, no obvious digrams, no obvious flag prefix_. It is exactly close enough to keep you trying — reverse the string, invert the bits, reverse each group, XOR with a constant. Every variation is more of the same. The problem is not the bit stream or the grouping; it is the alphabet.

### Bacon’s original alphabet#

Francis Bacon’s biliteral cipher, published in _De Augmentis Scientiarum_ (1623), predates the modern 26-letter English alphabet. Bacon used only **24 symbols** because two pairs of letters share a code:

```
    I / J  share one symbol
    U / V  share one symbol
```

The lookup table becomes:

```
    index:     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
    alphabet:  A B C D E F G H I K L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  W  X  Y  Z
```

Applying it to the 23 indices:

#| Bits| Value| Letter  
---|---|---|---  
0| `10001`| 17| `S`  
1| `00010`| 2| `C`  
2| `10000`| 16| `R`  
3| `01000`| 8| `I`  
4| `01110`| 14| `P`  
5| `10010`| 18| `T`  
6| `00010`| 2| `C`  
7| `10010`| 18| `T`  
8| `00101`| 5| `F`  
9| `01100`| 12| `N`  
10| `01101`| 13| `O`  
11| `10010`| 18| `T`  
12| `10100`| 20| `W`  
13| `00111`| 7| `H`  
14| `00000`| 0| `A`  
15| `10010`| 18| `T`  
16| `01000`| 8| `I`  
17| `10010`| 18| `T`  
18| `10001`| 17| `S`  
19| `00100`| 4| `E`  
20| `00100`| 4| `E`  
21| `01011`| 11| `M`  
22| `10001`| 17| `S`  
  
Concatenated:

```
    SCRIPTCTFNOTWHATITSEEMS
```

Split at the natural boundary and the plaintext resolves the title, the hint, and the flag body all at once:

```
    SCRIPTCTF | NOT WHAT IT SEEMS
```

### Restore the flag format#

Bacon’s alphabet cannot express braces, case, spaces, or underscores — it is a 24-symbol letter substitution and nothing else. The `SCRIPTCTF` prefix marks where the event wrapper ends; the remaining body is a continuous 14-letter phrase:

```
    NOTWHATITSEEMS
```

Applying scriptCTF’s flag format without inventing separators:

```
    scriptCTF{notwhatitseems}
```

### Reproduce the solve#

The [Python solver](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/scriptCTF-2026/tree/main/crypto/misdirection/scripts) validates the input length, groups into five-bit symbols, applies the original 24-letter alphabet, and prints the flag using only the standard library:

```
    python3 crypto/misdirection/scripts/solve.py
```

Output:

```
    Bacon plaintext: SCRIPTCTFNOTWHATITSEEMS
    Flag: scriptCTF{notwhatitseems}
```

Passing `--show-groups` prints the full per-group derivation table above.

### Takeaway#

**Read the length first, and read the historical alphabet before the modern one.** Both are the difference between a decoder that produces nonsense and a decoder that produces the flag. The modular arithmetic (`115 mod 8 = 3`, `115 mod 5 = 0`) forces the grouping without touching the bits. The Bacon vs. modern-alphabet distinction is the entire challenge — and both are documented in every reference on the cipher. The 160 points reward remembering that classical ciphers pre-date the modern English alphabet, not writing new code.

## F**K — Brainfuck as a timing-encoded comparator#

> _Flag:_ `scriptCTF{t1mm1ng_s1d$_ch@nn31}`
> 
> _Hint:_ “ABSOLUTELY NO SWEARING IS PERMITTED”

The handout is a single file named `funk` — no ELF header, no shebang. It weighs 28,786 bytes. The censored title and the “no swearing” rule are the first two hints: the language uses only eight ASCII punctuation characters, and the phonetic joke lands only if the file _is_ Brainfuck.

### Identify the language#

```
    $ file challenge/funk
    challenge/funk: ASCII text, with very long lines (28785)
    
    $ sha256sum challenge/funk
    c9aec8dacfeba0aa825b70fac870799ef22ef8190d5e9a4a7f2fc081e68f979c
```

Every non-whitespace byte belongs to `< > + - . , [ ]`, the complete Brainfuck instruction set. The raw counts are deliberately intimidating:

```
    + : 8376       - : 5273
    > : 7461       < : 7376
    [ :  126       ] : 126
    , :   38       . :    9
```

Two structural properties dispel the intimidation immediately. The brackets balance perfectly (126/126) and nest only **two levels deep** — no arbitrary control flow. And only 9 output instructions exist against 38 input instructions — the program reads far more than it writes.

### Establish the input length#

A small instrumented Brainfuck VM confirms that only 31 of the 38 `,` instructions actually execute; the remaining 7 sit inside dead decoy loops whose control cells are already zero when the loop is reached.

The 31 live reads write sequentially to cells `0..30`:

```
    input[0]  -> cell 0
    input[1]  -> cell 1
    ...
    input[30] -> cell 30
```

That matches the scriptCTF flag format exactly: `scriptCTF{` is 10 bytes, `}` is one, leaving a 20-byte body — 31 bytes total.

### Fold the visual noise#

Most of the 28 KB is algebraically redundant. Consecutive arithmetic collapses modulo 256:

```
    +++-+---++-   →   one net ADD (or SUB) of the summed constant
```

Pointer motion collapses the same way:

```
    >>>>><<<<<   →   no movement
```

Post-fold, only **395 top-level operations remain**. Every meaningful byte-check uses the same two-idiom template.

**Idiom 1 — multiply-and-transfer** (a temporary constant times a multiplier, deposited into the neighbouring cell):

```
    A [ - < K > ]
```

If the current cell starts at `A`, the loop decrements it to zero, adding `K` to the left neighbour each iteration. Net effect: left cell gains `A * K`.

**Idiom 2 — subtract-into-input** (drain the temporary into a distant input cell as subtraction):

```
    [ - <<...< - >...>> ]
```

Both the temporary and the far cell are decremented until the temporary reaches zero.

### Recover one target byte#

Each byte check reduces to four constants — `C`, `A`, `K`, and `B` — with the shape:

```
    input += C                          ← additive offset
    temporary = A * K + B               ← constructed constant
    input -= temporary
    residual = (input + C - (A*K + B)) mod 256
```

The residual is zero exactly when:

```
    expected = (A*K + B - C) mod 256
```

For input index 1, the constants come out to `C = 39, A = 8, K = 17, B = 2`, giving:

```
    expected = 8*17 + 2 - 39 = 99 = 'c'
```

That is the second byte of `scriptCTF`. Index 0 similarly:

```
    12*12 + 0 - 29 = 115 = 's'
```

The known `s` and `c` from the flag prefix confirm the formula and the byte-order convention before any unknown byte is decoded.

### Decode all 31 shuffled checks#

The comparisons are not laid out in input order. Scanning the folded program for the comparison template, recording the current input-cell pointer, and sorting by that pointer produces the full table:

Index| C| A| K| B| Target| Character  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
0| 29| 12| 12| 0| 115| `s`  
1| 39| 8| 17| 2| 99| `c`  
2| 73| 2| 93| 1| 114| `r`  
3| 17| 4| 30| 2| 105| `i`  
4| 75| 6| 31| 1| 112| `p`  
5| 83| 7| 28| 3| 116| `t`  
6| 33| 10| 10| 0| 67| `C`  
7| 84| 2| 84| 0| 84| `T`  
8| 61| 2| 65| 1| 70| `F`  
9| 22| 6| 24| 1| 123| `{`  
10| 76| 9| 21| 3| 116| `t`  
11| 22| 7| 10| 1| 49| `1`  
12| 43| 4| 38| 0| 109| `m`  
13| 29| 10| 13| 8| 109| `m`  
14| 82| 5| 26| 1| 49| `1`  
15| 43| 5| 30| 3| 110| `n`  
16| 54| 10| 15| 7| 103| `g`  
17| 65| 6| 26| 4| 95| `_`  
18| 27| 5| 28| 2| 115| `s`  
19| 61| 10| 11| 0| 49| `1`  
20| 32| 12| 11| 0| 100| `d`  
21| 49| 2| 42| 1| 36| `$`  
22| 77| 8| 21| 4| 95| `_`  
23| 29| 9| 14| 2| 99| `c`  
24| 22| 6| 21| 0| 104| `h`  
25| 45| 2| 54| 1| 64| `@`  
26| 71| 6| 30| 1| 110| `n`  
27| 73| 11| 16| 7| 110| `n`  
28| 74| 8| 15| 5| 51| `3`  
29| 87| 7| 19| 3| 49| `1`  
30| 23| 9| 16| 4| 125| `}`  
  
Concatenating the target bytes:

```
    scriptCTF{t1mm1ng_s1d$_ch@nn31}
```

The `$` at index 21 and `@` at index 25 look like glyph-recognition guesses but are exact byte values derived from the arithmetic:

```
    index 21:  2*42 + 1 - 49 = 36  = '$'
    index 25:  2*54 + 1 - 45 = 64  = '@'
```

No ambiguity, no hand-tuning.

### The timing channel — where the flag actually lives#

Every comparison finishes with `[-]`, the standard Brainfuck idiom to clear the current cell by decrementing until zero. With wrapping 8-bit cells:

```
    input == target      residual 0x00 → 0 clear iterations
    input == target + 1  residual 0x01 → 1 clear iteration
    input == target − 1  residual 0xff → 255 clear iterations   ← wraparound
```

The program prints nothing on success. It ends with:

```
    +[]
```

`+` makes the current cell nonzero, `[]` loops forever on it without changing it. **Every candidate input hangs.** What differs is the _number of Brainfuck instruction steps_ required to reach that sentinel — the flag is encoded entirely in that count.

Instrumented VM run on the recovered flag:

```
    steps to final +[] sentinel: 462101
    program output before sentinel: b''
    +1 mutation timing delta: min=2 max=2
    −1 mutation timing delta: min=510 max=510
```

Mutate any single byte up by one → 2 extra steps. Down by one → 510 extra steps (255 iterations × 2 instructions per iteration). The recovered candidate is the **unique global minimum** across all 31 independent residual loops. The hint `t1mm1ng_s1d$_ch@nn31` — deliberately spelled _“timing side channel”_ in leet — advertises the design in the flag itself.

### Reproduce the solve#

The [Python solver](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/scriptCTF-2026/tree/main/reverse/funk/scripts) parses the Brainfuck source into a folded AST, walks the tree to detect the four-constant comparison template, reconstructs every target byte, and validates the result with an instrumented 8-bit VM:

```
    python3 reverse/funk/scripts/solve.py challenge/funk
```

Relevant output:

```
    flag: scriptCTF{t1mm1ng_s1d$_ch@nn31}
    length: 31 bytes; input operations executed: 31
    steps to final +[] sentinel: 462101
    program output before sentinel: b''
    +1 mutation timing delta: min=2 max=2
```

Only the standard library — no `pip install brainfuck`.

### Takeaway#

**28 KB of Brainfuck is not 28 KB of logic** — it is a few hundred logic ops after algebraic folding, and every one of them fits the same four-constant template. The real hint is that the program has _no output_ : a checker that never prints “correct” is never comparing against a stored string; it must be comparing structurally. Once the comparison template is recognised, decoding the flag is a one-loop scan over the AST. The 454 points reward two moves — recognising the language, and recognising that the difficulty is _bulk_ , not _complexity_. The timing channel is the elegant flourish, not the attack: knowing the flag is the design goal is what tells you the algebra you’re looking at is a comparator rather than a computation.

## Cross-cutting lessons from scriptCTF 2026#

Two challenges, two categories, one repeated pattern:

  * **The first plausible interpretation is the trap, and the challenge title tells you so.** _Misdirection_ ’s modern Bacon mapping produces letters that look almost meaningful. F**K’s raw instruction counts (8,376 `+`, 7,461 `>`) look like a lot of logic. Both are engineered to consume time from anyone who does not verify their assumptions first.
  * **Read the shape before the content.** 115 bits is not 14 bytes — it is 23 five-bit groups. 28 KB of Brainfuck is not 28 KB of logic — it is 395 folded ops. In both cases the _modular arithmetic on the artifact size_ rules out a whole class of decode strategies before any code is written.
  * **Prefer the historical / structural reading over the modern / convenient one.** Bacon’s cipher is 24 letters, not 26. Brainfuck arithmetic is `mod 256`, not two’s-complement. When the “obvious” mapping produces near-nonsense, question the mapping, not the input.
  * **Use known plaintext to validate the decoder before decoding the unknown.** The `scriptCTF` prefix confirms both the Bacon 24-letter table (`S=17, C=2, R=16, I=8...`) and the F**K four-constant formula (`12*12 - 29 = 115 = 's'`) with zero ambiguity. A decoder that reproduces known plaintext is a decoder you can trust on the unknown body.
  * **Silence is a signal.** F**K prints nothing on success and hangs on every input. That is not a bug; it is the design. Whenever a program’s success path is silent and its failure path is indistinguishable from its success path, look for the difference in **time** , **memory** , or **side effect** — not output.
