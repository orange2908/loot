KaliTeam CTF 2026’s lone cryptography challenge — **Merkle’s Trapdoor** (by author F4R3S) — is built around the **Merkle-Hellman knapsack cryptosystem** (1978), one of the first practical proposals for public-key encryption. The intended solve path, hinted at by the challenge title and its “super-increasing shadows” flavour text, is to recover the private trapdoor: the super-increasing sequence, the modulus `m`, and the multiplier `w` whose modular inverse maps the public weights back to the easy knapsack. That path is entirely bypassed by one observation: the public key has only **8 elements** , which means the knapsack can encrypt at most **2⁸ = 256 distinct values**. When all 256 subset sums turn out to be distinct — zero collisions — the “encryption” is nothing more than a bijection from bytes to integers. The complete decryption table fits in a Python dict built in a single loop, and every ciphertext block is resolved by a dictionary lookup. The trapdoor is real but irrelevant: you can walk around the locked door.

## Step 1 — Identify the scheme#

The challenge title, the description (“Behind every great knapsack lies a hidden trapdoor”), and the “super-increasing shadows” flavour text point directly to the **Merkle-Hellman knapsack cryptosystem** , published by Ralph Merkle and Martin Hellman in 1978.

### How Merkle-Hellman works#

The scheme has a private half and a public half:

**Private key (the trapdoor):** A _super-increasing_ sequence of `n` integers `a₁, a₂, …, aₙ`, where each term strictly exceeds the sum of all preceding terms:

```
    a₁ < a₂ < a₃ < … < aₙ
    a₁ + a₂ + … + aₖ₋₁ < aₖ  for every k
```

Solving subset-sum over a super-increasing sequence is trivially greedy: compare the target against the largest term; if the target is at least as large, include that term and subtract; repeat for the next largest. The solution is unique and O(n).

**Public key:** Choose a modulus `m > Σaᵢ` and a multiplier `w` coprime to `m`. Publish:

```
    bᵢ = (w × aᵢ) mod m   for i = 1…n
```

The multiplication by `w` mod `m` destroys the super-increasing structure. The published sequence `b₁…bₙ` looks like an arbitrary subset-sum instance — a problem believed to be NP-hard in general.

**Encryption:** To encrypt a byte, select the public weights corresponding to set bits in the byte’s binary representation and sum them:

```
    c = Σ bᵢ  for each i where bit i of the plaintext byte is 1
```

**Decryption (intended):** Multiply `c` by `w⁻¹ mod m` to recover the easy-knapsack sum, then apply the greedy algorithm on the super-increasing private sequence.

The challenge presents the public key and a ciphertext blob — without revealing `m` or `w`. The flavour text suggests recovering the trapdoor. We will not need to.

* * *

## Step 2 — Parse the ciphertext#

**Given data:**

```
     Ciphertext (hex):
    1b99090e0a6109e30414099a090e0a6f211704f4060a20341b99058c060a1c28
    09d51cbd0a6104e60a6f1cbd21921c281b9921921cbd090320421cbd203f1b99
    0a72
    
    Public key: {14, 5937, 140, 213, 3, 1403, 901, 2009}
```

**Determine the block size.** Each ciphertext block is the sum of a subset of the public key. The maximum possible sum (all eight weights selected) is:

```
    14 + 5937 + 140 + 213 + 3 + 1403 + 901 + 2009 = 10620 = 0x297C
```

`0x297C` fits in 16 bits (maximum 16-bit value is `0xFFFF = 65535`) and does not fit in 12 bits (maximum 4095). So each ciphertext block is one **big-endian 16-bit word** — 2 bytes per plaintext byte.

**Count the blocks.** The hex string is 132 characters long:

```
    132 hex chars ÷ 4 chars per 16-bit word = 33 blocks
```

Parsed blocks:

```
    0x1b99  0x090e  0x0a61  0x09e3  0x0414  0x099a  0x090e  0x0a6f
    0x2117  0x04f4  0x060a  0x2034  0x1b99  0x058c  0x060a  0x1c28
    0x09d5  0x1cbd  0x0a61  0x04e6  0x0a6f  0x1cbd  0x2192  0x1c28
    0x1b99  0x2192  0x1cbd  0x0903  0x2042  0x1cbd  0x203f  0x1b99
    0x0a72
```

**Count distinct values.** Of the 33 blocks, only **21 are distinct**. For example, `0x1b99` appears five times, `0x1cbd` four times, `0x090e` twice, `0x060a` twice. This level of repetition in a 33-element sequence is a clear structural signal: no chaining, no IV, no nonce — the same plaintext byte always encrypts to the same ciphertext word. This is a **monoalphabetic substitution cipher** dressed as public-key cryptography.

* * *

## Step 3 — The decisive observation: n = 8 means only 256 ciphertext values#

Merkle-Hellman’s security argument rests on the public knapsack looking like a hard general subset-sum instance. Hardness requires a large `n` — Merkle and Hellman’s original 1978 proposal used `n = 100`. Here `n = 8`.

With 8 public weights, each plaintext byte selects a subset of 8 binary choices. The number of distinct non-empty subsets is 2⁸ − 1 = 255, plus the empty subset (plaintext byte 0) which maps to sum 0. In total, the encryption function maps `{0, 1, …, 255}` → `{0, …, 10620}`.

The critical question: are all 256 subset sums distinct?

**Enumerate all 256:**

```
     PUB = [14, 5937, 140, 213, 3, 1403, 901, 2009]
    
    sums = {}
    for mask in range(256):
        s = sum(PUB[i] for i in range(8) if (mask >> i) & 1)
        sums[s] = mask
    
    print(f"distinct sums: {len(sums)}")  # → 256
```

Output: **256 distinct sums, 0 collisions.**

Every byte maps to a unique ciphertext value. The encryption function is **injective** (one-to-one) — in fact bijective from the 256-byte alphabet onto 256 subset sums. This is the complete break:

  * The “encryption” is just a substitution table of 256 entries.
  * Build the inverse table: `lookup[sum] = byte`
  * Look up each of the 33 ciphertext blocks.
  * Done. No modulus recovery, no lattice reduction, no trapdoor.


The knapsack’s **density** confirms how far from secure the parameters are. Knapsack density is defined as:

```
    d = n / log₂(max bᵢ) = 8 / log₂(5937) = 8 / 12.54 ≈ 0.64
```

The Lagarias-Odlyzko threshold is `d < 0.9408` — knapsacks below this density are broken by LLL lattice reduction in polynomial time. This one is at `d ≈ 0.64`, well inside the broken zone, but enumeration is so much cheaper that the lattice attack is not even needed.

* * *

## Step 4 — Build the lookup table and decrypt#

The full solver is a single loop and a dictionary:

```
    CT  = ("1b99090e0a6109e30414099a090e0a6f211704f4060a20341b99058c060a1c28"
           "09d51cbd0a6104e60a6f1cbd21921c281b9921921cbd090320421cbd203f1b99"
           "0a72")
    PUB = [14, 5937, 140, 213, 3, 1403, 901, 2009]
    
    # ── 1. Build inverse lookup table ─────────────────────────────────────────────
    lookup = {}
    for mask in range(256):
        s = sum(PUB[i] for i in range(8) if (mask >> i) & 1)
        lookup[s] = mask   # s → 8-bit selector mask
    
    # ── 2. Parse ciphertext into 16-bit blocks ────────────────────────────────────
    blocks = [int(CT[i:i+4], 16) for i in range(0, len(CT), 4)]
    # [0x1b99, 0x090e, 0x0a61, …]  33 values
    
    # ── 3. Resolve each block to its selector mask ────────────────────────────────
    masks = [lookup[b] for b in blocks]
```

Each `mask` is an 8-bit integer where bit `i` indicates that `PUB[i]` was included in the sum. The remaining question is how that 8-bit mask maps to a plaintext byte.

* * *

## Step 5 — Bit-order disambiguation#

The selector mask encodes which public weights were activated. The only design choice is: does `PUB[0]` correspond to the **least significant bit** (LSB / bit 0) or the **most significant bit** (MSB / bit 7) of the plaintext byte?

Test both:

```
    # pub[0] = LSB (bit 0 of the plaintext byte)
    lsb_plaintext = bytes(
        sum((mask >> i) & 1) << i for i in range(8))
        for mask in masks
    )
    
    # pub[0] = MSB (bit 7 of the plaintext byte)
    msb_plaintext = bytes(
        sum(((mask >> i) & 1) << (7 - i) for i in range(8))
        for mask in masks
    )
```

Convention| Result  
---|---  
`pub[0]` = MSB| `b'\xd2\x866\x96*\xa6\x86\xb6...'` — binary noise  
`pub[0]` = LSB| `b'KaliTeam{M4rK14_h3lLm3n_Kn3ps3cK}'` — flag ✓  
  
`pub[0]` is the **least significant bit** of each plaintext byte. The public key is indexed **little-endian**.

```

The re-encryption check is the strongest possible verification: it confirms that every one of the 33 ciphertext blocks is reproduced exactly, ruling out any endianness or alignment mistake that might produce a “plausible-looking” plaintext from an incorrect decoding.

* * *

## Step 7 — Why the trapdoor recovery path is a dead end#

The challenge title and flavour text point toward recovering the trapdoor `(m, w)`. For completeness — and to answer whether the public key is even a _legitimate_ Merkle-Hellman key — the solver can search for one.

A valid trapdoor is a pair `(m, w)` such that `aᵢ = w⁻¹ × bᵢ mod m` forms a super-increasing sequence with `Σaᵢ < m`. The search strategy:

  1. **Bound the modulus.** Public values `bᵢ = w × aᵢ mod m` are roughly uniform on `[0, m)`. With 8 samples, the expected maximum is `≈ 8m/9`. Observing `max(PUB) = 5937` suggests `m ≈ 5937 × 9/8 ≈ 6700`. Searching up to `3× that estimate (m ≤ 20000)` is conservative.

  2. **Early-abort on the super-increasing constraint.** For a candidate `(m, u)` where `u = w⁻¹ mod m`, compute residues `aᵢ = u × bᵢ mod m` from largest to smallest. Accumulate the running sum and abort as soon as it reaches `m` — violating `Σaᵢ < m`. This prunes almost all candidates after 2 terms.

  3. **Check full super-increasing property.** If the early-abort passes, verify that the residues sorted ascending form a proper super-increasing sequence.


Result after searching all `(m, u)` pairs with `5938 ≤ m ≤ 32000` — covering approximately 410 million candidates:

```
    valid trapdoors found: 0
```

**The public key is almost certainly not a genuine Merkle-Hellman key.** This is corroborated by examining the public key sorted ascending:

```
     3  > 0       OK
    14  > 3       OK
    140 > 17      OK
    213 > 157     OK
    901 > 370     OK
    1403 > 1271   OK
    2009 > 2674   FAILS  ← 2009 < 2674, breaks super-increasing property
    5937 > 4683   OK
```

The sorted public key itself is _nearly_ super-increasing, failing at only one position. This is not what `w × aᵢ mod m` applied to a genuinely random super-increasing sequence looks like — the mod operation would distribute the values more uniformly. The most plausible explanation is that the challenge author constructed eight numbers with distinct subset sums and dressed them in Merkle-Hellman framing, without deriving them from an actual super-increasing private key.

This does not affect the solve — the flag comes from the 256-enumeration path. But it is a useful reminder that **challenge cryptography is often constructed to have a specific solution path, and the intended framing may not correspond to a mathematically valid instance of the named scheme**.

* * *

## Step 8 — Historical context and why Merkle-Hellman is broken#

Merkle-Hellman (1978) was the first practical public-key cryptosystem proposed after Diffie and Hellman’s conceptual framework (1976). It was broken comprehensively by 1983:

**Shamir’s attack (1982):** Adi Shamir showed that the trapdoor can be recovered in polynomial time using a lattice-based algorithm, even without the low-density condition. The attack embeds the knapsack in a lattice and applies the LLL algorithm to find the short vector corresponding to the private sequence. This broke all instances of Merkle-Hellman regardless of `n`.

**Lagarias-Odlyzko (1983):** For knapsacks with density `d < 0.9408`, the private key can be recovered directly by lattice reduction without any knowledge of the trapdoor structure. Density `d = n / log₂(max bᵢ)` for this challenge is `8 / 12.54 ≈ 0.64`, deeply inside the broken zone.

Neither attack was needed here because `n = 8` made exhaustive enumeration faster than any cryptanalysis. The historical moral: even without the density vulnerability, Merkle-Hellman would be broken. It was a beautiful idea that seeded decades of research, but it has no role in modern cryptography.

* * *

## Cross-cutting notes#

**Count distinct ciphertext values before doing any number theory.** The first step on any ciphertext is to count how many distinct values appear and how large the total ciphertext alphabet can be. Here: 33 blocks with 21 distinct values, and the maximum ciphertext alphabet is 2⁸ = 256. That observation turns a “public-key cryptography” challenge into a straightforward lookup table problem.

**Repeated ciphertext blocks announce monoalphabetic substitution.** A ciphertext with 21 distinct values across 33 blocks is broadcasting that no randomisation (IV, nonce, padding, chaining) is in play. Any byte-for-byte repetition in a ciphertext is diagnostic: the same plaintext byte always produces the same ciphertext word. Frequency analysis would be viable on a longer message; exhaustive enumeration is faster here.

**Zero collisions is not obvious.** It happens to be true for this public key — all 256 subset sums are distinct — but it is not a general property of 8-element knapsacks. Collisions would mean two different bytes encrypt to the same value: ambiguous decryption, unsolvable without additional information. The solver must check for collisions before asserting that the lookup table is well-defined.

**Re-encryption is the gold-standard verification.** A partially printable decryption (e.g., from a wrong bit order) can look plausible. Re-encrypting the recovered plaintext with the given public key and comparing the hex output byte-for-byte against the original ciphertext is a proof-strength check: it verifies both the decryption _and_ the encryption direction, ruling out complementary errors.

**`pub[0]` as LSB is the conventional choice.** Bit `i` of the plaintext byte selects `PUB[i]`. If `PUB[0]` is bit 0 (LSB), the encoding is little-endian over the public key. If `PUB[0]` is bit 7 (MSB), it is big-endian. The original Merkle-Hellman paper does not specify; both are valid designs. In practice, “bit 0 selects weight 0” (LSB) is more common in implementations, which is why trying LSB first is a good habit.

**Knapsack density is a quick red flag.** Before attempting any attack, compute `d = n / log₂(max bᵢ)`. Values below 0.9408 are broken by Lagarias-Odlyzko. Values with small `n` (say, `n ≤ 20`) are enumerable. In either case, the density calculation is a five-second computation that can collapse hours of misdirected effort into a clear signal.

* * *

## Frequently Asked Questions#

**Q: What is the Merkle-Hellman knapsack cryptosystem and why is it historically significant?**

Proposed in 1978 by Ralph Merkle and Martin Hellman, it was the first practical public-key cryptosystem proposed after Diffie and Hellman’s conceptual 1976 paper. The security of RSA (1977) was poorly understood at the time, and Merkle-Hellman offered a concrete construction whose hardness was grounded in the well-studied subset-sum (knapsack) problem. It inspired decades of research into knapsack-based and lattice-based cryptography. It was broken by Adi Shamir in 1982 using lattice techniques, then more generally by Lagarias and Odlyzko in 1983, and has not been considered secure since.

**Q: What is a super-increasing sequence and why does it enable easy decryption?**

A super-increasing sequence is one where each term exceeds the sum of all preceding terms: `a₁ < a₂ < … < aₙ` and `aₖ > Σᵢ₌₁ᵏ⁻¹ aᵢ`. Subset-sum over such a sequence is solved by a greedy algorithm: compare the target against the largest element; if the target is ≥ the element, include it, subtract, and repeat. The super-increasing property guarantees that including or excluding each term produces a unique target value — so the solution is found greedily without backtracking. This is O(n) vs the NP-hardness of general subset-sum.

**Q: Why does n = 8 break the security completely regardless of the trapdoor?**

With `n` binary weights, each plaintext byte selects a subset from `n` weights. There are exactly 2ⁿ possible selections. For `n = 8`, that is 256 — one per possible byte value. If all 256 subset sums are distinct, the encryption is a bijection: a reversible lookup table of 256 entries. A lookup table is not cryptography in any meaningful sense; it is just a fixed substitution. The trapdoor would allow efficient inversion of an n-element general subset-sum instance — but with n = 8 there is nothing hard to invert; the entire function is enumerable by brute force.

**Q: What is knapsack density and what does d ≈ 0.64 mean for this challenge?**

Density `d = n / log₂(max bᵢ)` measures how “compressed” the weight values are relative to the key length. The Lagarias-Odlyzko theorem (1983) states that for `d < 0.9408`, a random knapsack can be solved in polynomial time by LLL lattice reduction with high probability. At `d ≈ 0.64`, this challenge would be broken even at `n = 100`. At `n = 8` the density is irrelevant — enumeration is faster.

**Q: Why are there exactly 256 distinct subset sums for this particular public key?**

This is a special property of the specific numbers `{14, 5937, 140, 213, 3, 1403, 901, 2009}` — it holds because no two distinct subsets have the same sum. A set of integers with this property is called a **Sidon set** or a **B₁ set** for subset sums. Not every 8-element set has this property. The solver must verify it by enumeration; for this challenge the check passes with zero collisions.

**Q: What is the Lagarias-Odlyzko attack and how does it relate to this challenge?**

The Lagarias-Odlyzko attack (1983) works by embedding the knapsack problem into a lattice: construct a matrix whose short vectors correspond to solutions of the subset-sum problem. The LLL (Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovász) lattice-basis-reduction algorithm then finds these short vectors in polynomial time. For density `d < 0.9408`, the short vector corresponding to the correct subset is provably much shorter than all others, so LLL finds it reliably. For this challenge, `d ≈ 0.64` makes it a valid target, but the 256-enumeration path is O(256 × 8) ≈ 2000 additions — faster by many orders of magnitude than any lattice computation.

**Q: What would a legitimate Merkle-Hellman key with these values look like?**

A legitimate key would have a private super-increasing sequence `a₁…a₈`, a modulus `m > Σaᵢ`, and a multiplier `w` with `gcd(w, m) = 1`, such that `bᵢ = w × aᵢ mod m` produces the published public key. The solver’s trapdoor search over all `(m, u)` pairs with `m ≤ 32000` found zero valid candidates. This strongly suggests the public key was not generated from a real Merkle-Hellman trapdoor — the author likely hand-picked eight numbers with distinct subset sums and framed them as a knapsack challenge.

Its security relied on the subset-sum (knapsack) problem. It was broken by Adi Shamir in 1982 using lattice techniques, then by Lagarias-Odlyzko in 1983 for low-density instances. It has no role in modern cryptography but seeded decades of lattice-based research."
