Together with a binary called `flashdump.bin`

## TL;DR

The firmware serves an HTML page with the flag, which is decrypted using a  
hardcoded IV and key from an NVS key called `eeprom`. Extract the secrets,  
decrypt using AES-CBC and obtain the flag.

## Overview

Similar to the preceeding challenge, `BabySoC`, the provided file is a flash  
dump of an ESP32 firmware. This can be easily observed by looking at the strings  
within the binary file.

By binwalking the file, we see that, contrary to the first challenge, we now  
find both Rijndael AES-SBoxes within the flash contents:

```  
$ binwalk flashdump.bin 

DECIMAL HEXADECIMAL DESCRIPTION  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
65862 0x10146 HTML document header  
66286 0x102EE HTML document footer  
69043 0x10DB3 AES Inverse S-Box  
69299 0x10EB3 AES S-Box  
97967 0x17EAF Neighborly text, "neighbor entry"  
131380 0x20134 SHA256 hash constants, little endian  
159525 0x26F25 Intel x86 or x64 microcode, sig 0x014d061e, pf_mask 0x660660, 1D00-14-01, rev 0x-1000000, size 1  
160465 0x272D1 Intel x86 or x64 microcode, sig 0x014d061e, pf_mask 0x660660, 1D00-14-01, rev 0x-1000000, size 1  
```

Thus, we can already infer that we're looking for some AES-implementation that  
may have something to do with finding the flag.

## Analyzing the Flash Dump

Since the raw flash dump is not really useful without the memory map defined,  
we can use a tool such as [this one](<https://github.com/tenable/esp32_image_parser>)  
to convert the raw dump into a nice ELF file which then can be further analyzed  
with decompilation tools such as Ghidra.

By looking at the strings contained within the ELF, we can identify that the  
firmware seems to serve some HTML content that conditionally contains the flag  
in it in the function at `0x400d29b8`.

![](<https://github.com/TeamAustria/writeups/blob/main/2024-justctf/images/budgetsoc_html_flag_func.png?raw=true>)

The flag string itself is produced by the function at `0x400d296c`, which takes  
in memory copied originally from the internal SRAM address `0x3ffc3e38 + 100`.

By analyzing the function `0x400d296c`, we can easly see that this is some AES  
decryption function (uses the AES sboxes discovered before by the binwalk) and  
uses a hardcoded key and IV. Thus the AES-scheme is most likely CBC. This hints  
that the input to this decryption function is some ciphertext of length `0x20`,  
so two AES-blocks / 32 bytes.

By digging more into the code and analyzing XREFs near the memory location from  
which the ciphertext is copied from, we find that it seems to be assigned in  
`0x400d7ba8` called from the static data init function at `0x400d2bec`. This  
function seems to read something from the NVS, which is a partition in the  
flash image that can be used to store nonvolatile data (Non-Volatile-Storage).  
More specifically, the code refers to some `eeprom` key in the NVS.

We can use the same ESP32 image parser [tool](<https://github.com/tenable/esp32_image_parser>)  
from before to extract the NVS partition to a separate bin file and then use a  
tool such as [this](<https://github.com/AFontaine79/Espressif-NVS-Analyzer>) to  
print out the NVS contents in a structured way.

```

In the NVS, we find the `eeprom` key, which is a 132-byte large binary blob,  
the `ff`'s are just empty padding. This perfectly matches the data we expect,  
since we want a 32-byte ciphertext blob at the offset 100 from some string.

## Decrypting

Thus, we can use the last 32 bytes of this field, extract the key and IV from  
their respective locations in the flash using Ghidra and write a quick and  
simple Python script to decrypt the flag. Alternatively also possible to be done  
using tools such as Cyberchef.

```python  
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from Crypto.Cipher import AES

key = b"\x33\xbd\xfb\x72\x4c\x22\x87\x33\x62\xff\x75\x41\xd5\x14\xf6\xfd"  
iv = b"\x00"*16  
eeprom_ct = bytes.fromhex("7468697369736E6F7461666C6167009BB03FAD04F45C7CE5BF66628A045A5AF0458DC09FCE6040C69168EFDD2655657EA0854BF05FFCD5F5045315DF8331D3D5505DE127457C045EF5DEE73A01E3BA3DD3CE909D394F131876C3D826AE2953E4499EC3FF3A595EB55FCE7A6FB15352AA6CE13A998F967437BA2C705F6CADA39D2C5B5401")

cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)  
pt = cipher.decrypt(eeprom_ct[-32:])

print(pt)  
```

And we get the output

```  
$ ./[decrypt.py](http://decrypt.py)   
b'justCTF{dUmp3d_r3v3rs3d_h4ck3d}\x01'  
```
