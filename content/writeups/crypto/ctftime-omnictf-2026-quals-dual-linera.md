**OmniCTF 2026 Quals** shipped a crypto track built around one recurring lesson — **the algebra is scarier than the actual attack surface** — and this **CyberSecurity Elite** writeup solves all three of its challenges. Three challenges, all rated medium, and every one dresses a mundane linear-algebra collapse in a costume the reader is expected to spend hours investigating. **dual_linera** uses two-modulus LWE where the error `e` is shared across both moduli. CRT is a linear map, so `e` survives the reconstruction and 18 samples plus LLL on a 20x20 lattice recover the 96-bit secret. **Whiskerfield-Meowtin** offers a “CuteSecure-DH” whose modulus is `65537^16` (Fermat prime to the 16th power) and whose public value is hand-crafted as one byte-flip away from a multiple of 65537. Patch the byte, drive the shared secret to zero, decrypt under the LCG stream cipher. **Orbital-Strike-Cannon** wraps a 9-unknown affine state in non-associative octonion multiplication, a published-stream “broken RNG”, and 7 satellites (5 real, 2 fake), but once you fix the association order it becomes 8x8 matrix multiplication, and once you write the samples as linear equations a per-satellite RREF sorts real from fake without needing the private `real_ids`.

Handouts, per-challenge READMEs, and pure-stdlib Python solvers live at [Abdelkad3r/OmniCTF-2026-Quals](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/OmniCTF-2026-Quals).

## The three OmniCTF 2026 Quals crypto challenges#

Challenge| Difficulty| Bug class / primitive| Flag  
---|---|---|---  
dual_linera| Medium| Sage generator produces two coprime primes `q1 ~ 2^180`, `q2 ~ 2^181`, a 96-bit secret `s`, and 18 samples `(a1, a2, y1, y2)` where `y1 = a1*s + e mod q1` and `y2 = a2*s + e mod q2` share **the same** 176-bit `e`. CRT collapses each pair into `Y ≡ A*s + e (mod Q)` with `Q = q1*q2 ~ 2^361`, same `s`, same `e`. `log Q / log e ~ 2.05` per sample, 18 samples plenty for LLL. Build a 20x20 lattice with weights `W_S = 2^80` on the secret column and `W_K = 2^176` on the shift row, LLL-reduce, read `s` off the row whose last coordinate is `±W_K`. Flag XOR’d against SHAKE256(SHA256(str(s))).| `OmniCTF{crt_makes_a_tiny_nonce_without_leaking_it}`  
Whiskerfield-Meowtin| Medium (76 solves)| Stripped Linux `.so` implementing CuteSecure-DH. Modulus in `.rodata` is 64 hex chars; constructor pokes a `'1'` byte at offset 64, making the full string `65` hex chars = `65537^16`. Fermat prime raised to the 16th power. Wrapper’s `generate_public_key_near_multiple` starts with a multiple of 65537 and XORs one byte with a small mask so it’s no longer a multiple, telling you to XOR the byte back. Patch one byte so `A' ≡ 0 (mod 65537)`; since `b ≥ 2^127 >> 16`, `A'^b ≡ 0 (mod 65537^16)`. Shared secret is 0. Decrypt payload with the reverse-engineered LCG stream (glibc `rand()` multiplier + drifting increment).| `OmniCTF{I_just_LOVE_the_sm3ll_0f_f34r_1ab27f8d}`  
Orbital-Strike-Cannon| Medium (115 solves)| Octonion state over `F_{2^127 - 1}` via Cayley-Dickson. Public: `alpha`, `beta`, `outer_a`, `rng_beacons` (full published LCG stream), 7 satellites each with `{arange, mask_offset, basis, bias, coords}`. Secret: `moon0` (8 F_P values) + `x0` (scalar) + `rng_u`, `rng_v` (LCG params). Non-associative `((R_i * M_i) * alpha)` collapses to `mat_right(alpha) * mat_left(R_i)` = one 8x8 matrix. State becomes affine map `[M_i, X_i, 1] = states[i] * [M_0, X_0, 1]`. 5 real satellites × 15 exact linear equations = 75 equations in 9 unknowns. Per-satellite RREF `[coefs| rhs]`: fake satellites produce `[0..0 | nonzero]`inconsistency rows. RNG params recovered from two consecutive beacon differences:`u = (b_2 - b_1) / (b_1 - b_0)`, `v = b_1 - u*b_0`.  
  
The three challenges share a discipline worth stating up front: **the exotic algebra is a costume**. Every one of these primitives has a scary name (LWE, non-associative Cayley-Dickson, DH over `Z/p^k`), but the actual attack surface reduces to 20th-century linear algebra plus one specific structural mistake per challenge. dual_linera’s mistake is sharing `e` across two moduli through a linear (CRT) map. Whiskerfield’s is using a modulus whose group `(Z/p^k)^*` has an obvious filtration by powers of `p`, plus a wrapper that hand-delivers the near-multiple. Orbital’s is fixing the association order and publishing the RNG state, which turns the non-associativity into a `mat_left`/`mat_right` bookkeeping distinction rather than a security feature. Once you name the mistake, the exploit is Python plus (in one case) LLL.

## Methodology — write everything linearly first#

A pattern that worked on every challenge in this set: **before touching the scary primitive, write out every quantity you know as a linear function of the unknowns**. dual_linera’s `y1, y2` are linear in `(s, e)` per row; CRT is linear; the composite `Y ≡ A*s + e (mod Q)` is linear. Whiskerfield’s DH is exponential, but the specific exploit (`A'^b ≡ 0 (mod p^k)`) turns on divisibility, which is a purely arithmetic property. Orbital’s octonion multiplication is non-associative, but the `((R_i * M_i) * alpha)` expression is `mat_right(alpha) * mat_left(R_i) * M_i` which is one 8x8 matrix in `F_P^8`. Once every quantity is linear (or reducible to divisibility), the exploit is a rank test, a lattice reduction, or a byte patch. No number theory, no algebraic geometry, no cryptographic infrastructure. Just linear algebra and one specific structural observation per challenge.

The correlate is: **don’t try to invert the scary primitive**. dual_linera does not require inverting the LWE-per-modulus rows on their own (each has ratio `log q / log e ~ 1.02`, hopeless); it requires _combining_ them into one row with a better ratio. Whiskerfield does not require solving discrete log mod `65537^16` (nobody knows how to do that efficiently); it requires forcing the shared-secret computation into a divisibility corner where the value is 0. Orbital does not require inverting octonion multiplication (there’s no invertible-octonion trick that helps here); it requires recognising that non-associativity only affects the order-of-composition bookkeeping, and once fixed the whole system is linear.

Per-challenge walkthroughs follow.

## 1\. dual_linera#

Two-modulus LWE with a shared 176-bit error `e`. CRT collapses each sample pair into one equation with the same `e`; 18 samples plus LLL on a 20-dimensional lattice recover the 96-bit secret.

### Step 1 — Spot the shared invariant#

Generator (Sage):

```
    q1 = random_prime(2^180, ...)
    q2 = random_prime(2^181, ...)   # coprime to q1
    s  = randrange(0, 2^96)         # 96-bit secret
    for _ in range(18):
        a1 = randrange(1, q1)
        a2 = randrange(1, q2)
        e  = randrange(0, 2**176)   # <-- one draw per sample
        y1 = (a1 * s + e) % q1
        y2 = (a2 * s + e) % q2
```

`a1` and `a2` are independent, but the same `e` is used on both sides. Without that sharing, each row on its own is bounded-error LWE with `|e|/q ~ 2^{-4}`; the noise floor is basically the modulus, no lattice will save you. The shared `e` turns two seemingly-independent weak rows into one strong small-error row.

### Step 2 — CRT collapse#

Let `Q = q1 * q2 ~ 2^361` and pick CRT coefficients:

```
    u = q2 * pow(q2, -1, q1) % Q     # ≡ 1 mod q1, ≡ 0 mod q2
    v = q1 * pow(q1, -1, q2) % Q     # ≡ 0 mod q1, ≡ 1 mod q2
```

Note `u + v ≡ 1 (mod Q)`. For each sample:

```
    A_i = (a1_i * u + a2_i * v) % Q
    Y_i = (y1_i * u + y2_i * v) % Q
```

Then:

```
    Y_i ≡ a1_i*s*u + e*u + a2_i*s*v + e*v
        ≡ s*(a1_i*u + a2_i*v) + e*(u + v)
        ≡ A_i * s + e     (mod Q)
```

18 equations, same `s`, same `e`. `|s| < 2^96`, `|e| < 2^176`, `Q ~ 2^361`. `log Q / log e ~ 2.05` per sample. Well inside LLL’s reach.

### Step 3 — Build the 20x20 lattice#

Standard LWE construction with weights so every coordinate lands at the same scale:

```
    W_S = 2^(E_BITS - SECRET_BITS) = 2^80    # weight on secret
    W_K = 2^E_BITS                 = 2^176   # weight on shift
```

For `n = 18`, build the `(n+2) x (n+2) = 20 x 20` matrix:

```
    row 0     : [ W_S | A_1  A_2 ...  A_n | 0   ]     <- s row
    row i>=1  : [ 0   | 0    ... Q ... 0  | 0   ]     <- Q on column i
    row n+1   : [ 0   | Y_1  Y_2 ...  Y_n | W_K ]     <- shift row
```

Coefficients `(s, k_1, ..., k_n, -1)` on the rows produce the target short vector:

```
    target = (s * W_S, -e, -e, ..., -e, -W_K)
```

Every coordinate has magnitude ~2^176, so total L2 norm is `sqrt(20) * 2^176`. Way shorter than the generic Minkowski bound for a 20-dimensional lattice with determinant `W_S * W_K * Q^n`. LLL finds it (or a small integer multiple of it).

### Step 4 — Read `s` from the reduced basis#

After LLL, scan for a row whose last coordinate is `±W_K`. That row is (up to sign) the target. Column 0 divided by `W_S` gives `±s`; take the positive representative. Sanity check on sample 0:

```
    e0  = (y1_0 - a1_0 * s) % q1
    e0p = (y2_0 - a2_0 * s) % q2
    assert e0 == e0p < 2**180
```

Then derive the stream key and decrypt:

```
    key    = hashlib.sha256(str(s).encode()).digest()
    stream = hashlib.shake_256(key).digest(len(ct))
    flag   = xor_bytes(ct, stream)
    # b'OmniCTF{crt_makes_a_tiny_nonce_without_leaking_it}'
```

Recovered secret: `67133769516566898715085291836` (exactly 96 bits). Flag body reads _“CRT makes a tiny nonce without leaking it”_ : the flag literally names the vulnerability class.

Per-challenge README + solver: [crypto/dual_linera](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/OmniCTF-2026-Quals/tree/main/crypto/dual_linera).

Two portable lessons. **A “small” quantity shared linearly across two coprime moduli is a single leak, not two.** After CRT the effective modulus is `prod q_i` and the error is still whatever it was on one side. Design your ratios against `Q`, not against each `q_i` individually. Same failure applies to hidden-number problem instances sharing a nonce across two moduli, biased-nonce ECDSA collated across two curves, small-CRT-exponent RSA where a bounded quantity leaks on both mod-p and mod-q sides. **You don’t need Sage to solve LLL-sized CTF crypto.** A 20x20 pure-Python LLL is silly slow (~90 minutes on an M-series laptop) but correct; drop-in Sage or fpylll for a much faster reduction if you want to reproduce fast. But the algorithm is the same either way.

## 2\. Whiskerfield-Meowtin#

CuteSecure-DH over `65537^16`. The wrapper hands you `A` one byte-flip away from a multiple of 65537. Patch the byte, shared secret is 0, decrypt with the LCG stream cipher.

### Step 1 — Read the wrapper’s public-key construction#

`wrapper.py` (250 lines of Python, no cryptography of its own) has one function that gives the whole game away:

```
    def generate_public_key_near_multiple(length: int) -> bytes:
        while True:
            seed = bytearray(secrets.token_bytes(length))
            seed[0] |= 0x40
            target = int.from_bytes(seed, "big")
            target -= target % 65537              # target is a MULTIPLE of 65537
            if target <= 1:
                continue
            target_bytes = bytearray(target.to_bytes(length, "big"))
            for _ in range(length * 8):
                byte_index = secrets.randbelow(length)
                mask = secrets.choice((0x01, 0x02, 0x04, 0x08, 0x11, 0x55, 0x80))
                candidate = bytearray(target_bytes)
                candidate[byte_index] ^= mask
                if int.from_bytes(candidate, "big") % 65537 != 0:
                    return bytes(candidate)      # !=0 by design, but 1 XOR away
```

Reading this out loud: _start with a multiple of 65537, XOR one byte with a small mask so it’s no longer a multiple, return that_. The message is unsubtle. The challenge wants you to XOR that byte back, which is exactly what “one byte to patch, one shot” from the prompt buys.

Also relevant: the private exponent has its top bit forced:

```
    def generate_private_exponent_hex(length=16):
        random_bytes = bytearray(secrets.token_bytes(length))
        random_bytes[0] |= 0x80        # b >= 2^127
        random_bytes[-1] |= 0x11
        return random_bytes.hex()
```

So `b >= 2^127`. Hold on to that.

### Step 2 — Find the modulus in the stripped `.so`#

```
    $ nm -D libcutecrypto.so | grep -E 'SecureChannel|CuteBigInt::FromHex'
    0000000000083190 T SecureChannel::SecureChannel()
    0000000000083490 T SecureChannel::ModPow(...)
    0000000000083b80 T SecureChannel::ProcessMitm(...)
    00000000000860f0 T CuteBigInt::FromHex(std::string)
```

`.rodata` at `0x1341b0` has 64 ASCII hex chars:

```
    1001000780230071c11101f482cb032462cb01f481110071c023000780010000
```

Factoring the resulting integer gives small primes and one random 108-bit prime. Not obviously a DH modulus.

The tell is a few instructions into the constructor at `0x83190`:

```
    movdqa xmm0, [0x1341b0]         ; bytes 0-15
    movups [rax], xmm0
    mov   byte [rax + 0x40], 0x31   ; poke '1' at byte 64  <-- !!
    movups [rax + 0x10], xmm0       ; bytes 16-31
    movdqa xmm0, [0x1341d0]
    movups [rax + 0x20], xmm0       ; bytes 32-47
    movdqa xmm0, [0x1341e0]
    movups [rax + 0x30], xmm0       ; bytes 48-63
```

The four `movdqa/movups` writes lay down the 64 `.rodata` bytes, then `mov byte [rax + 0x40], 0x31` writes `'1'` at byte 64. The `CuteBigInt::FromHex` input is 65 hex chars:

```
    "1001000780230071c11101f482cb032462cb01f481110071c023000780010000" + "1"
    = 0x1001000780230071c11101f482cb032462cb01f481110071c0230007800100001
```

Sanity check:

```
    >>> R = int("1001000780230071c11101f482cb032462cb01f481110071c023000780010000", 16)
    >>> R * 16 + 1 == 65537 ** 16
    True
```

The modulus is `65537^16`: Fermat prime raised to the 16th power.

### Step 3 — Why “multiple of 65537” is the whole game#

The peer performs `shared = A'^b mod 65537^16`. Suppose we patch `A` so `A' = 65537 * m` for some integer `m`. Then:

```
    A'^b = (65537 * m)^b = 65537^b * m^b
```

`65537^16` divides `65537^b` whenever `b >= 16`. And the wrapper guarantees `b >= 2^127 >> 16`. So:

```
    65537^b ≡ 0 (mod 65537^16)  for all b >= 16
```

which forces:

```
    shared = A'^b ≡ 0 (mod 65537^16)   always.
```

This is the classical “prime power is a bad DH modulus” trap. The group `(Z/p^k)^*` has an obvious filtration by powers of `p`, and any input divisible by `p` collapses to 0 after `k` levels of exponentiation.

### Step 4 — Enumerate valid one-byte patches#

For byte position `i` (0-indexed from the left) and candidate value `v`:

```
    int(A_new) = int(A) + (v - A[i]) * 256^(23 - i)
```

We want that `≡ 0 (mod 65537)`. Since `gcd(256, 65537) = 1`, `256^(23-i)` is invertible mod 65537, so exactly one `v` in `[0, 65537)` works per position. It’s a candidate iff that `v` fits in `[0, 256)`.

Useful observation: `256^2 = 65536 ≡ -1 (mod 65537)`, so powers of 256 mod 65537 cycle through `{1, 256, -1, -256}`. For a 24-byte `A`, only positions where `256^(23-i)` is `±1` can produce a valid `v < 256`. In practice ~12 valid positions per instance; the wrapper guarantees at least one exists (it’s the byte it XOR’d during setup).

```
    def find_zero_mod_patches(A: bytes):
        n = len(A)
        A_int = int.from_bytes(A, "big")
        for i in range(n):
            weight = pow(256, n - 1 - i, 65537)
            winv   = pow(weight, -1, 65537)
            target = (A[i] - A_int * winv) % 65537
            if 0 <= target <= 255:
                yield i, target
```

For `A = 5fa9e673f2e450da6c32a46e06864926883b81ed3744dd77`, the first candidate is `1:29` (change byte 1 from `0xa9` to `0x29`, XOR `0x80`, one of the wrapper’s allowed masks).

### Step 5 — Reverse the KDF from `ProcessMitm`#

`ProcessMitm` (`0x83b80`) is ~22 KB of unrolled bignum plumbing, but the payload construction at the tail is short.

Shared-secret hash at `0x84410`:

```
    h = 0xc0dec0de
    for b in shared_bytes:
        h = ((b ^ h) * 0x19660d + 0x3c6ef35f) & 0xffffffff
```

Stream cipher over the flag at `0x84470`:

```
    state = h
    for i in range(len(flag)):
        state = (state * 0x41c64e6d + i * 0x21 + 0x3039) & 0xffffffff
        out[i] = (state >> 16) ^ (i * 0xd) ^ flag[i]
```

`0x41c64e6d` is glibc’s `rand()` multiplier; `0x3039 = 12345` is its increment. The homebrewed part is that the increment drifts by `0x21` per iteration and output is XOR’d with a byte counter stepping by 13. Both deterministic, both irrelevant to the attack.

### Step 6 — Serialise `shared = 0`#

One empirical question: how does the bignum library encode 0 as bytes before feeding it to the hash? Three natural candidates:

  * Empty byte string.
  * Single `0x00` byte.
  * Fixed 32-byte zero-padded encoding.


The solver enumerates all three. For this build the answer is **a single`0x00` byte**, giving:

```
    seed = ((0 ^ 0xc0dec0de) * 0x19660d + 0x3c6ef35f) mod 2^32 = 0x9e4532a5
```

Keystream bytes: `83 12 59 36 c8 93 ...`. XOR with observed payload `cc 7f 37 5f 8b c7 ...`: `4f 6d 6e 69 43 54 = "OmniCT"`.

### Step 7 — Fire#

Three questionable choices compound in Whiskerfield, each embarrassing on its own. **DH mod`p^k` is a footgun.** The group `(Z/p^k)^*` is not the one you want DH in; its filtration by powers of `p` makes inputs divisible by `p` collapse to 0 after enough exponentiation. Use safe-prime moduli (`p = 2q + 1` with `q` prime) or work over `Z/p` with a large-order subgroup. **Trust nothing about`A`.** If the peer will trustingly compute `A^b`, at minimum check `gcd(A, p) = 1`; better, check that `A` has the right order in the target subgroup. **The construction of`A` is documentation for the attacker.** Anything shaped like _“start with X, perturb it a little, return that”_ is a written invitation to reverse the perturbation. Attackers read code; helpful comments and helpful constructions help them first.

## 3\. Orbital-Strike-Cannon#

Three costumes stacked on one problem: non-associative octonions, a “broken RNG” with published stream, and 7 satellites (5 real, 2 fake). All three go away as soon as you write things linearly.

### Step 1 — Read the constants#

```
    P               = (1 << 127) - 1     # Mersenne prime
    N_STATES        = 34
    N_SATELLITES    = 7
    REAL_SATELLITES = 5
    COORDS_PER_SAMPLE     = 3
    SAMPLES_PER_SATELLITE = 5
```

State evolution:

```
    moon_{i+1}  = add(o_mul(o_mul(R_i, M_i), ALPHA), BETA)
    orbit_{i+1} = (outer_a * orbit_i + sum(M_i) + rng_i) % P
```

`o_mul` is octonion multiplication over `F_P` via Cayley-Dickson. Note `((R_i * M_i) * ALPHA)`: the parenthesisation is fixed, `alpha` and `beta` are public.

Encryption:

```
    secret_material = vec_to_bytes(moon0 + [x0, rng_u, rng_v])
    key             = sha256(b"OSC-KEY|" + secret_material).digest()
    ciphertext      = shake_xor(key, flag)
    firing_code     = sha256(key + b"|fire").hexdigest()[:32]
```

Public in `public_json`: `alpha`, `beta`, `outer_a`, `rng_beacons` (the whole LCG stream), `satellites` (7 records with `{arange, mask_offset, basis, bias, coords}`), `ciphertext`. Secret: `moon0` (8 F_P values), `x0` (scalar), `rng_u`, `rng_v`.

### Step 2 — The “broken” RNG hands you `u`, `v`#

```
    class BrokenRNG:
        def next(self):
            out = self.state
            self.state = (self.u * self.state + self.v) % P
            return out
```

`rng_beacons[i+1] = u * rng_beacons[i] + v (mod P)`. Two consecutive differences:

```
    u = (b_2 - b_1) * (b_1 - b_0)^{-1} mod P
    v =  b_1 - u * b_0                 mod P
```

That leaves `moon0` (8) and `x0` (1). Nine unknowns.

### Step 3 — Non-associativity, meet linear algebra#

`build_state_expressions` already spells the trick out:

```
    transition = mat_mul(mat_right(alpha), mat_left(r_oct))
```

  * `mat_left(o)` is the 8x8 matrix representing `x → o_mul(o, x)`.
  * `mat_right(o)` is the 8x8 matrix representing `x → o_mul(x, o)`.


So:

```
    o_mul(o_mul(R_i, M_i), ALPHA)
        = mat_right(ALPHA) * (R_i * M_i)
        = mat_right(ALPHA) * mat_left(R_i) * M_i
```

One 8x8 matrix. Even though the underlying algebra is non-associative, the `(A B) C ≠ A (B C)` failure lives inside the `mat_left`/`mat_right` distinction. Once you pick a side, matrices compose associatively as usual.

Extend the 8-dim moon to a 10-dim affine state `[M, X, 1]`:

  * 8 rows for moon: `transition[8x8] * M + BETA * 1`.
  * 1 row for orbit: `outer_a * X + <1,1,...,1> * M + rng_i * 1`.
  * 1 row for the constant slot: identity.


Stacking `N_STATES + 3` step matrices gives, for each `i`, a 10x10 matrix `states[i]` such that:

```
    [M_i, X_i, 1] = states[i] * [M_0, X_0, 1]
```

The 11-dim feature vector `feature[idx] = M_idx || [X_idx, X_{idx+1}, X_{idx+2}]` is then an `11 x 10` known matrix `A_idx` times the 10-dim unknown `[M_0, X_0, 1]`.

### Step 4 — Each real sample is one linear equation#

For a real satellite at time index `idx = start + step * t`:

```
    mask   = rng_beacons[idx + mask_offset]        # public
    y_j    = mask * <basis_row_j, feature[idx]> + bias_j
```

`basis_row_j`, `bias_j`, `mask` are all in the JSON. Rearrange:

```
    <basis_row_j, feature[idx]> = (coord_j - bias_j) * mask^{-1} mod P
```

Substitute `feature[idx] = A_idx * [M_0, X_0, 1]`:

```
    (basis_row_j^T * A_idx) . [M_0, X_0, 1] = (coord_j - bias_j) * mask^{-1} mod P
```

The dot with `basis_row_j` collapses the 11 rows of `A_idx` into a single 10-dim coefficient vector. The last entry multiplies the constant slot `1`; move it to the RHS. **One linear equation in 9 unknowns per coordinate.**

Per satellite: 5 sample times × 3 coords = **15 equations**. Real: all 15 fit the true `(M_0, X_0)`. Fake: coords are `rnd_vec(...)`, so 15 random RHS values; augmented rank vs coefficient rank differ almost surely (`Pr[accidental consistency] ~ 1/P^6`).

### Step 5 — Sort real from fake with per-satellite RREF#

For each satellite, build augmented matrix `[coefs | rhs]`, Gauss-eliminate mod `P`. If any row is `[0, 0, ..., 0 | non-zero]`, the satellite is fake. Otherwise real.

On the live instance: `{sat-01, sat-02, sat-03, sat-04, sat-06}` real, `{sat-00, sat-05}` fake. Matches `REAL_SATELLITES = 5`.

### Step 6 — Solve, decrypt, submit#

Stack the ~75 real equations, RREF, read `(M_0, X_0)` off the reduced matrix. Recover `u, v` from `rng_beacons`. Rebuild the key, print the firing code, decrypt locally.

Three portable lessons. **If you can write it as a matrix, do.** Non-associative algebras scare cryptographers when the operation is being composed _many_ times with variables in the middle. As soon as the association order is fixed and one of the operands is public, the operation becomes an 8x8 matrix mod `P` and the algebra ends. **A “broken” RNG whose state you transmit is just a KDF input.** Public RNG state is not a secret you can rekey around; it’s a public parameter. If you want key material out of an LCG, keep the state private. **In mixed real/fake channels with an exact linear model, rank tests are all you need.** No priors, no ground truth, no majority vote: RREF per channel and be done.

## Cross-cutting defender notes#

Five patterns recur across the OmniCTF 2026 Quals crypto track and translate directly into review or triage heuristics.

**Any small quantity shared linearly across two moduli is one leak, not two.** dual_linera’s error `e` looks safe when you’re computing modulo `q1` alone (`|e|/q1 ~ 2^{-4}`, hopeless for lattice), but the CRT reconstruction is a linear map over the integers, so the shared `e` survives. Same failure applies to hidden-number problem instances that share a nonce across two moduli, biased-nonce ECDSA collated across two curves, or small-CRT-exponent RSA where a bounded quantity leaks on both mod-p and mod-q sides. Design your ratios against the composite modulus, not against each factor.

**DH modulus choice matters at least as much as key length.** Whiskerfield’s `65537^16` is 256 bits (bigger than a lot of production DH moduli), but the group `(Z/p^k)^*` has a filtration by powers of `p`. Inputs divisible by `p` collapse to 0 after `k` levels of exponentiation. Safe-prime moduli (`p = 2q + 1` with `q` prime) or working over `Z/p` with a large-order subgroup are the standard defences. Same class: DH over composite `n = p*q` (nobody does this, but people have done it in coursework and shipped it), DH over elliptic curves with small embedding degree, DH over `Z/2^n` (also bad).

**Validate every peer-supplied group element.** Whiskerfield’s peer will trustingly compute `A^b` for any 24-byte `A` the wrapper hands out. `gcd(A, p) = 1` would have caught this specific bug at essentially zero cost. Better: verify that `A` has the correct order in the target subgroup (check `A^(order) == 1` and `A^(order/prime) != 1` for each prime dividing the order). Same class: ECDH curve validation (Bleichenbacher-style attacks on invalid curve points), Schnorr signature validation of public keys, any protocol where the peer contributes a group element and you exponentiate it.

**Non-associativity is not a security property when association order is fixed.** Orbital’s octonion multiplication is genuinely non-associative, but every `((R_i * M_i) * alpha)` in the state evolution has the parenthesisation baked in. `mat_right(alpha) * mat_left(R_i)` is one 8x8 matrix; the non-associativity lives inside the `mat_left`/`mat_right` bookkeeping and does not survive matrix composition. If you want to use a non-associative algebra as a security primitive, the operation has to be applied _variably_ (attacker chooses the parenthesisation) and one of the operands has to be secret. Otherwise it’s just linear algebra with two flavours of “multiply by X” matrices.

**Publishing the RNG stream doesn’t hide anything.** Orbital’s “broken RNG” has its whole output stream printed as `rng_beacons`. Two consecutive differences give up the LCG parameters `(u, v)`. Any protocol whose security depends on a pseudorandom stream but publishes the stream itself is a plain-text protocol with theatrical framing. If the RNG state is meant to be secret, keep it secret; if it’s public parameters, treat it that way in the security model.

## Frequently asked questions#

### What is OmniCTF 2026 Quals?#

OmniCTF 2026 Quals is the qualifier round of the OmniCTF 2026 competition, with challenges spanning web, pwn, reverse, crypto, game, misc, and forensics. Flags use event-specific namespaces (`CTF{...}`, `OMNICTF{...}`, `OmniCTF{...}`, `omniCTF{...}`) depending on the challenge author. This writeup covers the three crypto challenges I solved (dual_linera, Whiskerfield-Meowtin, Orbital-Strike-Cannon). The paired [web](https://cybersecurityelite.com/ctf-writeups/omnictf-2026-quals-web-writeup/), [pwn](https://cybersecurityelite.com/ctf-writeups/omnictf-2026-quals-pwn-writeup/), and [reverse](https://cybersecurityelite.com/ctf-writeups/omnictf-2026-quals-reverse-writeup/) writeups on the same site cover the other tracks.

### How does dual_linera’s CRT collapse turn two-modulus LWE into one small-error equation?#

The generator produces `y1 = a1*s + e mod q1` and `y2 = a2*s + e mod q2` with the same `e` on both sides. On its own, each row has ratio `|e|/q ~ 2^{-4}`: hopeless for lattice reduction. Take CRT coefficients `u ≡ 1 mod q1, u ≡ 0 mod q2` and `v ≡ 0 mod q1, v ≡ 1 mod q2` with `u+v ≡ 1 mod Q` where `Q = q1*q2`. Then `Y_i = y1_i*u + y2_i*v ≡ (a1_i*u + a2_i*v)*s + e*(u+v) ≡ A_i * s + e (mod Q)`. Same `s`, same `e` across all 18 samples. `log Q / log e ~ 2.05` per sample makes LLL on a 20-dimensional lattice tractable.

### Why does the 20x20 lattice work for dual_linera?#

Weights `W_S = 2^80` and `W_K = 2^176` scale the secret column and shift row so the target short vector `(s*W_S, -e, -e, ..., -e, -W_K)` has every coordinate around `2^176`. Total L2 norm is `sqrt(20) * 2^176`, far shorter than the generic Minkowski bound for a 20-dim lattice with determinant `W_S * W_K * Q^n`. LLL reliably finds it. Read `s` off the row whose last coordinate is `±W_K`.

### Why is CuteSecure-DH’s `65537^16` modulus catastrophic?#

The group `(Z/p^k)^*` has structure `(Z/p^{k-1}) x (Z/(p-1))^*` and a filtration by powers of `p`. Any input divisible by `p` sits in the “kernel” of the reduction mod `p^{k-1}`, and `k` levels of exponentiation collapse it to 0. Since the private exponent `b >= 2^127 >> 16`, `A'^b ≡ 0 (mod 65537^16)` for any `A'` divisible by 65537. The wrapper hands you an `A` one byte-flip away from a multiple of 65537. Patch the byte, `A' = 65537 * m`, `shared = 0`.

### How do you find the one-byte patch for Whiskerfield?#

For 24-byte `A` and byte position `i`, we want a candidate value `v` such that `int(A_new) ≡ 0 mod 65537`. `256^2 ≡ -1 mod 65537`, so powers of 256 cycle through `{1, 256, -1, -256}`. Only positions where `256^(23-i)` is `±1` can produce a valid `v` in `[0, 256)`. Compute `weight = pow(256, 23-i, 65537)`, `winv = pow(weight, -1, 65537)`, `target = (A[i] - A_int * winv) % 65537`. If `0 <= target <= 255`, position `i` with value `target` is a valid patch. ~12 candidates per instance; the wrapper guarantees at least one exists.

### How is Whiskerfield’s shared secret serialised to bytes for the KDF?#

The `.so`’s bignum library encodes 0 as a single `0x00` byte (rather than empty string or fixed-32-byte padding). Feeding that through the shared-secret hash yields `h = ((0 ^ 0xc0dec0de) * 0x19660d + 0x3c6ef35f) mod 2^32 = 0x9e4532a5`. That seed drives the LCG stream cipher (glibc `rand()` multiplier `0x41c64e6d`, increment `0x3039 + i*0x21`, output XOR’d with `i*0xd` per byte). Solver enumerates the three natural encodings; single `0x00` matches on this build.

### Why does Orbital-Strike-Cannon’s non-associative octonion multiplication reduce to 8x8 matrix multiplication?#

The state evolution fixes `((R_i * M_i) * alpha)` as the parenthesisation. Define `mat_left(o)` = 8x8 matrix representing `x -> o_mul(o, x)` and `mat_right(o)` = matrix representing `x -> o_mul(x, o)`. Then `o_mul(o_mul(R_i, M_i), alpha) = mat_right(alpha) * mat_left(R_i) * M_i`, a single 8x8 matrix in `F_P^8`. Non-associativity `(A B) C ≠ A (B C)` lives inside the `mat_left` vs `mat_right` distinction, but once each `(o, side)` maps to a matrix, matrices compose associatively as usual. Extend to a 10-dim affine state `[M, X, 1]` and stack step matrices.

### How does per-satellite RREF sort real from fake in Orbital-Strike-Cannon?#

For each satellite, build the augmented matrix `[coefs | rhs]` from its 15 samples (5 time steps × 3 coords). Real satellites’ `coords` are exact affine measurements of the true `[M_0, X_0, 1]`, so the augmented matrix is consistent: RREF finishes with no all-zero coefficient rows against nonzero RHS. Fake satellites’ `coords` are random `rnd_vec(...)` values from `F_P^15`, so the augmented rank exceeds the coefficient rank almost surely; RREF produces at least one row `[0, 0, ..., 0 | nonzero]`, marking the satellite as fake. Probability of accidental consistency is `~1/P^6` per fake satellite, negligible for `P = 2^127 - 1`.

### How do you recover the LCG parameters `u, v` from Orbital’s beacon stream?#

`rng_beacons[i+1] = u * rng_beacons[i] + v (mod P)`. Two consecutive differences: `b_2 - b_1 = u * (b_1 - b_0) mod P`, so `u = (b_2 - b_1) * (b_1 - b_0)^{-1} mod P`. Then `v = b_1 - u * b_0 mod P`. Requires `b_1 - b_0` invertible mod P, which is essentially always true for `P = 2^127 - 1`. Once `u, v` are recovered, the RNG contributes no secret material; the only remaining unknowns are `moon0` (8) and `x0` (1), which the per-satellite equations solve.

### What’s the broader lesson from the OmniCTF 2026 Quals crypto track?#

_The exotic algebra is a costume._ Every one of these primitives has a scary name (two-modulus LWE, DH over `Z/p^k` with Fermat prime base, non-associative Cayley-Dickson octonions), but the actual attack surface reduces to 20th-century linear algebra plus one specific structural mistake. dual_linera’s mistake is sharing `e` across two moduli through the linear CRT map. Whiskerfield’s is using a prime-power modulus whose group has an obvious filtration plus a wrapper that hand-delivers the near-multiple. Orbital’s is fixing the association order and publishing the RNG state. Name the mistake first, invert the algebra second (or don’t, when a rank test suffices).

### Where can I find the solver scripts?#

Per-challenge READMEs, handouts, and pure-stdlib Python solvers at [Abdelkad3r/OmniCTF-2026-Quals](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/OmniCTF-2026-Quals). All three solvers use only the Python standard library (no `pycryptodome`, no `pwntools`). dual_linera’s solver ships its own pure-Python integer LLL (slow but correct: ~90 minutes on a 20x20 lattice; use Sage or fpylll for a millisecond-scale reduction). Whiskerfield and Orbital solvers finish in seconds. All three reproducible against fresh remote instances.

## Closing notes#

Three crypto challenges pulled together by one discipline: **write everything linearly first, and if you can’t, ask why not**. dual_linera’s `y1, y2` become one linear equation after CRT. Whiskerfield’s DH exponentiation becomes divisibility once you notice `65537^16` is a prime power. Orbital’s octonion state becomes 8x8 matrix multiplication once the association order is fixed. Every one of these is a structural mistake dressed as exotic algebra, and every one has a real-world analogue in production systems that have shipped essentially the same bug.
