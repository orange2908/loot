**VuwCTF 2026** ’s three crypto challenges share one idea: **the expensive-looking thing is a thin disguise over one clean algebraic fact.** `nom-nom` (100 pts, Easy) dresses an RSA flag as a template around an inner message — which is exactly the linear relation the Franklin–Reiter attack needs. `concord` (100 pts, Medium) flexes a key schedule that costs 35 trillion operations, all of which evaporate once you notice its core operation is multiplication in `GF(257)` and Fermat’s little theorem zeroes the exponent. `D` (316 pts, Hard) builds a 16-round `GF(2^128)` block cipher whose only nonlinear layer is a Dickson polynomial — a _permutation_ polynomial with a closed-form inverse. This writeup solves all three step by step, with the algebra spelled out.

All challenge files and solvers are at [Abdelkad3r/VuwCTF-2026](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/VuwCTF-2026/tree/master/Crypto). Every flag is verified by re-encrypting the recovered plaintext against the given parameters — not guessed.

## Challenge 1 — nom-nom (Easy, 100 pts)#

We get an RSA modulus `n` (2048-bit), `e = 3`, and **two** ciphertexts:

```
    e = 3
    n = 2370719799...45971
    c_flag_inner = 1133267644...89781     # RSA(inner message)
    c_flag       = 9527654200...50991973  # RSA(VuwCTF{ inner })
```

The flag is `VuwCTF{<inner>}` with `<inner>` exactly 16 ASCII bytes → 24-byte plaintext.

### Step 1 — Write the relation between the two plaintexts#

The two plaintexts aren’t independent; the second is the first wrapped in a fixed 8-byte envelope. As big-endian integers:

```
    m_flag = P·256^17 + m_inner·256 + S
           = A·m_inner + B
      where  A = 256
             B = P·256^17 + S
             P = int.from_bytes(b"VuwCTF{")   (7 bytes)
             S = int.from_bytes(b"}")         (1 byte)
```

`A` and `B` are fully known constants. The only unknown is `m_inner`.

### Step 2 — Recognize Franklin–Reiter#

Two ciphertexts of _related_ messages — `m_2 = f(m_1)` for a known low-degree `f` — under a **shared modulus** and **small`e`** are exactly the setup for the **Franklin–Reiter related-message attack** (CRYPTO ‘96). With `e = 3` and `f(x) = A·x + B`, both of these polynomials in `(Z/nZ)[x]` vanish at `x = m_inner`:

```
    g_1(x) = x^3 − c_flag_inner
    g_2(x) = (A·x + B)^3 − c_flag
```

So `(x − m_inner)` divides both, and with overwhelming probability their gcd is exactly that linear factor:

```
    h(x) = gcd(g_1, g_2)  =  x − m_inner       (monic, degree 1)
```

Reading `m_inner` off the constant term recovers the message.

### Step 3 — gcd over a ring that isn’t a field#

`Z/nZ` is not a field (`n = p·q`), so the Euclidean algorithm needs a guard: each reduction inverts the divisor’s leading coefficient with `pow(lc, -1, n)`. If that inverse fails, `gcd(lc, n) > 1` — which means we just **factored`n`**, an even better outcome. In practice it never triggers here; the reduction returns a degree-1 polynomial on the first pass. The solver implements `poly_mod`/`poly_gcd` over `Z/nZ` in pure Python `int`s — no SymPy, no Sage.

### Step 4 — Solve and verify#

```
    $ python3 solve.py
    gcd deg = 1
    m_inner       = 104258345777904576648690201020578295661
    m_inner bytes = b'NomPolynomialNom'
    FLAG          = VuwCTF{NomPolynomialNom}
    [+] both ciphertexts verified
```

The two `assert`s re-encrypt the recovered plaintexts under `(n, e)` and confirm they reproduce both original ciphertexts — the flag is proven, not guessed.

### Flag#

```
    VuwCTF{NomPolynomialNom}
```

**Why not Håstad?** Håstad’s broadcast attack wants `e` ciphertexts of the _same_ plaintext under `e` _distinct_ moduli. Here we have two ciphertexts of _different_ plaintexts under _one_ modulus — Franklin–Reiter is the tool that matches the givens. `e = 3` is the sweet spot: `(A·x + B)^e − c_2` has degree `e`, so the Euclidean reduction is `O(e^2)` polynomial operations.

* * *

## Challenge 2 — concord (Medium, 100 pts)#

> I encrypted the flag on a powerful HPC cluster and my poor laptop can’t decrypt it no matter how hard it tries.

Two files: `concord.py` (encryptor) and `concord.ciphertext` (hex AES-CBC). The encryptor:

```
    from random import seed, randbytes
    from functools import reduce
    seed("concord")
    
    def op(a, b):
        return (a+1)*(b+1) % 257 - 1
    
    rand_input = randbytes(2**30)          # 1 GB of deterministic PRNG bytes
    state = 0
    key = []
    for j in range(32):
        for i in range(1023):
            state = op(reduce(op, (op(rand_input[j+i], b) for b in rand_input)), state)
        key.append(state)
    
    cipher = AES.new(bytes(key), AES.MODE_CBC, iv=bytes.fromhex("243f57341528c28727458b8cc5f52786"))
    print(cipher.encrypt(flag).hex())
```

The key schedule is `32 × 1023 = 32,736` outer steps, each sweeping all `2^30` bytes of `rand_input` → `≈ 3.5 × 10^13` operations. That’s the “HPC” flavor. The whole challenge is realizing you never have to run it.

### Step 1 — `op` is multiplication in GF(257)#

257 is prime, so `GF(257)` exists. Define φ(x) = x + 1. Then:

```
    φ(op(a,b)) = (a+1)(b+1) mod 257 = φ(a)·φ(b)
```

`op` is field multiplication shifted down by 1. Consequently `reduce(op, [v_0,…,v_{n-1}]) + 1 = ∏ (v_i + 1) mod 257`.

### Step 2 — The billion-byte inner sweep is constant#

The inner generator is `op(rand_input[j+i], b) for b in rand_input`. Let `c = rand_input[j+i] + 1`. In the field, each term is `c·(b+1)`, so the whole reduce is:

```
    reduce(...) + 1 = ∏_b [ c·(b+1) ] = c^n · P      where n = 2^30,  P = ∏(b+1) mod 257
```

Now apply Fermat: `GF(257)*` is cyclic of order 256, and **256 | 2^30** , so `c^(2^30) = (c^256)^(2^22) = 1`. The `c^n` factor vanishes:

```
    inner reduce ≡ P − 1     for every j, i, regardless of rand_input[j+i]
```

The 1 GB sweep is a red herring — it always produces the same constant `P − 1`.

### Step 3 — The key is a geometric sequence in P#

Each outer step becomes `state = op(P−1, state)`, i.e. φ(state_new) = P·φ(state_old). From `state = 0` (φ = 1), after `k` steps φ(state) = P^k. Key byte `j` is stored after `(j+1)·1023` steps:

```
    key[j] = P^(1023·(j+1)) − 1  mod 257 = P^(255·(j+1) mod 256) − 1     (since 1023 ≡ 255 mod 256)
```

### Step 4 — Only 256 possible P → brute force#

`P ∈ GF(257)*` has just 256 possible values. Try each, rebuild the 32-byte key, AES-CBC-decrypt, and check for the `VuwCTF{` prefix:

```
    for log_p in range(256):
        P = pow(3, log_p, 257)                              # 3 is a primitive root mod 257
        key = bytes(pow(P, 1023*(j+1) % 256, 257) - 1 for j in range(32))
        pt = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv=iv).decrypt(ct)
        if pt[:7] == b"VuwCTF{":
            print(pt.rstrip(pt[-1:].ljust(1, pt[-1:])).decode()); break
```

```
    P = 239  (log_3 239 = 178)
    Key: 9ce9f30e29a83de073dd9e21c5f547fc8e5b33c4585e087f318b8678eb2be10f
    Flag: VuwCTF{crypto_loves_mathematics}
```

Runs in under a millisecond. The `\x10`×16 PKCS#7 padding confirms a 32-byte plaintext padded to 48 bytes.

### Flag#

```
    VuwCTF{crypto_loves_mathematics}
```

**The three-line collapse:** (1) `op` is `GF(257)` multiplication; (2) Fermat kills the `2^30`-fold inner product to a single constant `P`; (3) only 256 values of `P` exist. `O(3.5×10^13)` → `O(256)` AES decryptions.

* * *

## Challenge 3 — D (Hard, 316 pts)#

> Not the programming language, sadly.

Handout: `D.sage` (encryptor) and `flag.png.encrypted`. The cipher operates over `GF(2^128)` (block size = one field element):

```
    key = random.Random(b"p-box").randbytes(128)         # deterministic — no secret
    F.<x> = GF(340282366920938463463374607431768211456)  # 2^128
    R.<y> = PolynomialRing(F)
    
    def D(n, a):                                          # Dickson recurrence
        if n == 0: return 0
        if n == 1: return y
        return y*D(n-1, a) - a*D(n-2, a)
    
    p = D(13, F.from_integer(19))                         # nonlinear round function
```

### Step 1 — Read the structure#

The key stream is derived from a fixed seed `b"p-box"` — there is **no unknown secret**. This is not key recovery; it’s inverting a transformation. The mode is CBC-like (each block XORed with the previous ciphertext), and `encrypt_block` runs 16 rounds of:

  1. XOR the next deterministic round key,
  2. apply the field polynomial `p = D_13(x, 19)`,
  3. a 4×4 ShiftRows-style byte permutation.


The permutation is trivially invertible. The only real question is inverting the polynomial.

### Step 2 — A Dickson polynomial is a permutation polynomial#

Dickson polynomials satisfy the composition identity:

```
    D_m(D_n(x, a), a^n) = D_{mn}(x, a)
```

Over `GF(q)`, `D_n(x, a)` permutes the field iff `gcd(n, q^2 − 1) = 1`. Here `q = 2^128`, `n = 13`, and `gcd(13, 2^256 − 1) = 1` — so `D_13` is a bijection with a clean inverse. Pick

```
    m = 13^{-1} mod (2^256 − 1)
```

Then `D_m(·, 19^13)` inverts `D_13(·, 19)`, because `D_m(D_13(x, 19), 19^13) = D_{13m}(x, 19) = D_1(x, 19) = x` (the exponent `13m ≡ 1`). Verified in Sage on random elements:

```
    m = inverse_mod(13, 2^256 - 1)
    z = F.random_element()
    assert D(m, F(19)^13)(D(13, F(19))(z)) == z
```

### Step 3 — Invert one round, then the chain#

Encryption of one round is `state = ShiftRows(D_13(state ⊕ round_key, 19))`, so decryption reverses it:

```
    state = D_m( UnshiftRows(state), 19^13 ) ⊕ round_key
```

Apply the 16 rounds in reverse order to turn each ciphertext block back into its CBC-mixed block, then XOR off the previous ciphertext block to recover the true PNG block.

### Step 4 — Run the Sage solver#

```
    $ sage solve.sage
    [+] ciphertext blocks: 725
    [+] inverse exponent m: 53442502724915167118571223850163649778432300614911029556672731080575290603047
    [+] wrote: artifacts/flag.png
    [+] sha256(flag.png): 6b244e866a232b4941dc19db8590972eb51af7e745e81c9bb6d0fbbdab1d1f12
    [+] elapsed: 32.812s
    [+] flag: VuwCTF{permuting_permutation_polynomials}
```

The recovered `flag.png` renders the flag.

### Flag#

```
    VuwCTF{permuting_permutation_polynomials}
```

**The whole trick** is recognizing `D_13(x, 19)` as a Dickson polynomial and knowing its permutation condition. Once `gcd(13, 2^256 − 1) = 1` holds, the “custom block cipher” is a stack of individually reversible layers, and the flag name — _permuting permutation polynomials_ — is the hint stated outright.

* * *

## Cross-cutting notes#

**The costly surface is the disguise; find the algebraic identity underneath.** All three challenges advertise difficulty they don’t actually have. nom-nom’s “two RSA ciphertexts” is a linear relation; concord’s 35-trillion-operation key schedule is one `GF(257)` constant; D’s “custom cipher” is a permutation polynomial with a closed-form inverse. Reversing crypto is mostly identifying which known structure the author dressed up.

**Small`e` \+ a known relation between plaintexts = Franklin–Reiter.** Whenever you see two RSA ciphertexts under one modulus where one plaintext is a known low-degree function of the other (a fixed prefix/suffix, a counter, a linear tweak), compute the polynomial gcd of `x^e − c_1` and `f(x)^e − c_2` over `Z/nZ`. The message falls out as the linear factor.

**Fermat’s little theorem is the great collapser.** In `GF(p)*` any exponent that is a multiple of `p − 1` is the identity. concord’s billion-byte inner loop raises a field element to the `2^30`, and `256 | 2^30`, so it’s just `1`. When a challenge makes you exponentiate by a suspiciously round number, check it mod the group order first.

**Permutation polynomials are invertible by design.** Dickson polynomials `D_n(x, a)` permute `GF(q)` exactly when `gcd(n, q^2 − 1) = 1`, and the inverse is `D_m(x, a^n)` with `m = n^{-1} mod (q^2 − 1)`, thanks to the composition identity `D_m(D_n(x,a),a^n) = D_{mn}(x,a)`. A “nonlinear round function” built from one is not a one-way function.

**Deterministic “keys” mean it’s not key recovery.** Both concord and D derive their key material from a fixed, public seed. When the RNG is seeded with a constant, there is no secret to recover — the challenge is always about inverting a transformation you can fully reconstruct.

* * *

## Frequently Asked Questions#

**Q: What is the Franklin–Reiter related-message attack?**

It recovers RSA plaintexts when two messages `m_1` and `m_2 = f(m_1)` (for a known low-degree polynomial `f`) are encrypted under the _same_ modulus with a _small_ public exponent `e`. Both `g_1(x) = x^e − c_1` and `g_2(x) = f(x)^e − c_2` have `m_1` as a root, so `(x − m_1)` divides their gcd over `(Z/nZ)[x]`. With overwhelming probability that gcd is exactly `x − m_1`, revealing the message. In nom-nom, `f(x) = 256·x + B` because the flag is the inner message wrapped in the fixed `VuwCTF{…}` envelope.

**Q: How do you compute a polynomial gcd over Z/nZ when n isn’t prime?**

Run the Euclidean algorithm as usual, but to make each divisor monic you must invert its leading coefficient modulo `n` with `pow(lc, -1, n)`. If that inverse doesn’t exist, then `gcd(lc, n)` is a nontrivial factor of `n` — you’ve factored the modulus, which breaks RSA outright. For nom-nom this never triggers and the gcd reduces to a linear polynomial on the first attempt.

**Q: Why does concord’s billion-byte key schedule collapse to 256 possibilities?**

The operation `op(a,b) = (a+1)(b+1) mod 257 − 1` is multiplication in `GF(257)` under the map φ(x) = x+1. The inner loop multiplies `2^30` field elements, which factors as `c^(2^30) · P`. Since `GF(257)*` has order 256 and `256` divides `2^30`, Fermat’s little theorem makes `c^(2^30) = 1`, so every inner reduce equals the single constant `P − 1`. The key becomes a geometric sequence in `P`, and `P` has only 256 possible values in `GF(257)*` — trivially brute-forced.

**Q: What is a Dickson polynomial and when is it invertible?**

A Dickson polynomial `D_n(x, a)` is defined by the recurrence `D_n = x·D_{n-1} − a·D_{n-2}` with `D_0 = 2`… (here `D_0 = 0`, `D_1 = x` per the challenge’s variant). Over `GF(q)` it is a permutation polynomial — a bijection — exactly when `gcd(n, q^2 − 1) = 1`. Its inverse is `D_m(x, a^n)` where `m = n^{-1} mod (q^2 − 1)`, which follows from the composition identity `D_m(D_n(x, a), a^n) = D_{mn}(x, a)`.

**Q: How is the D challenge inverted if it’s a custom block cipher?**

Because there is no secret key (it’s seeded from a constant) and every layer is reversible. Each of the 16 rounds is XOR-key → `D_13(x, 19)` → ShiftRows. The ShiftRows permutation is directly invertible, and `D_13` is inverted by `D_m(x, 19^13)` with `m = 13^{-1} mod (2^256 − 1)` since `q = 2^128`. Undo the rounds in reverse, then undo the CBC chaining with the previous ciphertext block to recover the flag PNG.

**Q: What are the flags for the VuwCTF 2026 crypto challenges?**

nom-nom: `VuwCTF{NomPolynomialNom}`. concord: `VuwCTF{crypto_loves_mathematics}`. D: `VuwCTF{permuting_permutation_polynomials}`.
