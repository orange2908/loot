**Problem description**:
```
We are trying to break into their safe storage. We have exposed the panel of the lock mechanism and revealed a circuit. Go to the organizers table and see if you can unlock the entry to the storage.

This was a cool onsite challenge where you were given a circuitboard, and you had to figure out which setting of the 16 toggle switches was correct. Of course, you could brute force this and it would only take about 18 hours ;)

Anyways, I first took a front and back photo of the board:
![front](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perfectblue/ctf-writeups/db9b964bf35c210567ea508383e91a9c423adaee/2018/midnightsun-ctf-2018-finals/crazy-circuit-conundrum/front.png)
![back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perfectblue/ctf-writeups/db9b964bf35c210567ea508383e91a9c423adaee/2018/midnightsun-ctf-2018-finals/crazy-circuit-conundrum/back.png)

Then, after struglging with GIMP I combined the two layers to better see the contacts on both sides of the PCB. I also went ahead and labeled the logic gates and enumerated each contact for easier analysis.

![combined](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perfectblue/ctf-writeups/db9b964bf35c210567ea508383e91a9c423adaee/2018/midnightsun-ctf-2018-finals/crazy-circuit-conundrum/combined.png)

The general strategy is to start from the LEDs at the top and work backwards. Tracing the circuit connections it's essentially like a DFS to build up a list of binary logical relations for all the contacts. Here is what I got from tracing the left LED:

```
5   =   AND(1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9)
1   =   28
28  =   AND(26, 27)
26  =   74
78  =   NOT(73)
73  =   A
27  =   B
2   =   31
31  =   AND(29,30)
29  =   95
95  =   NOT(94)
94  =   M
30  =   G
3   =   24
24  =   AND(22,23)
22  =   E
23  =   O
4   =   21
21  =   AND(19,20)
20  =   K
19  =   90
90  =   NOT(89)
89  =   H
6   =   34
34  =   AND(32, 33)
32  =   74
74  =   NOT(73)
73  =   A
33  =   78
78  =   NOT(77)
77  =   C
7   =   35
35  =   AND(133,134)
133 =   33
134 =   42
8   =   43
43  =   AND(41,42)
41  =   86
86  =   NOT(85)
85  =   D
42  =   105
105 =   NOT(104)
104 =   P
9   =   40
40  =   AND(38,39)
38  =   F
39  =   41
```

So, I wrote a quick and dirty Python script to parse this into an AST and evaluate it. Then, I fed it into Z3, which spit out:

```
And(Not(A),
    B,
    Not(M),
    G,
    E,
    O,
    Not(H),
    K,
    Not(C),
    Not(P),
    Not(D),
    F)
A = 1
B = 0
C = 1
D = 1
E = 0
F = 0
G = 0
H = 1
I = ?
J = ?
K = 0
L = ?
M = 1
N = ?
O = 0
P = 1
10110001??0?1?01
```

Funny, we used Z3 to solve a *physical* boolean circuit. :P

That means all but 4 of the switches are solved, which means there's only 16x2 (2 because all switches could be inverted) combinations to try. That was enough to solve the problem.
