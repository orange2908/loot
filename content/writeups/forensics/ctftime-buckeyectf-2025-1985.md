### Step 1: Analyzing the Source Email and Identifying the Encoding

The challenge began with a text block presented as an old email from 1985.

```text  
Hey man, I wrote you that flag printer you asked for:

begin 755 [FLGPRNTR.COM](http://FLGPRNTR.COM)  
MOAP!@#PD=`:`-"I&Z_6Z'`&T"<TAP[1,,,#-(4A)7DQ1;AM.=5,:7W5_61EU  
;:T1U&4=?1AY>&EAU95AU3AE)&D=:&T9O6%<D  
`  
end  
```

**Artifact Analysis:**  
The key elements for identification are the `begin 755 [FLGPRNTR.COM](http://FLGPRNTR.COM)` and `end` directives. This structure is a classic indicator of **uudecode** (Unix-to-Unix decoding) encoding. This is a legacy method for converting binary files into ASCII text strings for safe transmission through systems that originally only supported text (like early email).

* `begin` - Marks the start of the encoded file.  
* `755` - Represents the file's permissions in Unix format.  
* `[FLGPRNTR.COM](http://FLGPRNTR.COM)` - The name of the file to be created upon decoding.

### Step 2: Decoding the Payload

After identifying the format, the next step was to decode the data to retrieve the original `[FLGPRNTR.COM](http://FLGPRNTR.COM)` file. Since standard libraries for `uudecode` can be missing or deprecated in modern Python versions, a custom decoder was written to reliably handle the data.

The following Python [script](<https://github.com/NEMO246/WRITEUP_CTF/blob/main/BuckeyeCTF%202025/forensics/1985/decode.py>) implements the `uudecode` logic manually. It reads the encoded lines, skipping the header and footer, and converts each line from its text representation back into binary bytes.

```python  
# This program implements a manual decoder for the uuencode format.

lines = []  
recording = False  
# The encoded data from the email  
data = """begin 755 [FLGPRNTR.COM](http://FLGPRNTR.COM)  
MOAP!@#PD=`:`-"I&Z_6Z'`&T"<TAP[1,,,#-(4A)7DQ1;AM.=5,:7W5_61EU  
;:T1U&4=?1AY>&EAU95AU3AE)&D=:&T9O6%<D  
`  
end  
"""

# Parse the input data to extract only the encoded lines  
for line in data.splitlines():  
if line.startswith("begin "):  
recording = True  
continue  
if line.startswith("end"):  
break  
if recording:  
lines.append(line.strip())

# Function to decode a single uu line  
def uudecode_line(line):  
if not line:  
return b''  
# The first character determines the length of the decoded bytes in the line  
length = (ord(line[0]) - 32) & 0x3F  
line = line[1:]  
out = bytearray()  
while line:  
chunk, line = line[:4], line[4:]  
# Convert 4 ASCII characters into 3 bytes  
nums = [(ord(c) - 32) & 0x3F for c in chunk]  
a, b, c, d = nums + [0] * (4 - len(nums))  
out.extend([  
(a << 2 | b >> 4) & 0xFF,  
(b << 4 | c >> 2) & 0xFF,  
(c << 6 | d) & 0xFF  
])  
return bytes(out[:length])

# Decode all lines and join them  
decoded = b''.join(uudecode_line(l) for l in lines if l and not l.startswith('`'))

# Write the result to a binary file  
with open("[FLGPRNTR.COM](http://FLGPRNTR.COM)", "wb") as f:  
f.write(decoded)

```  
Executing this script successfully created the binary file `[FLGPRNTR.COM](http://FLGPRNTR.COM)`.

### Step 3: Analyzing and Executing the Binary

The resulting file, `[FLGPRNTR.COM](http://FLGPRNTR.COM)`, is a 16-bit executable program for MS-DOS. Such programs cannot be run directly on modern 64-bit operating systems.

**Analysis and Emulation:**  
An MS-DOS emulator was required to run the file. **DOSBox** is the standard tool for such tasks. The process for running the program in DOSBox was as follows:

1\. Launch DOSBox.  
2\. Mount the current directory as the `C:` drive using the command:  
`mount c .`  
3\. Switch to the mounted `C:` drive:  
`c:`  
4\. Run the program by typing its name:  
`[FLGPRNTR.COM](http://FLGPRNTR.COM)`

![DOSBox Execution](<https://github.com/NEMO246/WRITEUP_CTF/raw/main/BuckeyeCTF%202025/forensics/1985/images/1.png>)

After executing these commands, the program ran and printed the flag directly to the emulator's console.
