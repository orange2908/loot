![Lost File Challenge](<https://github.com/NEMO246/WRITEUP_CTF/raw/main/Securinets%20CTF%20Quals%202025/Lost%20File/images/Lost_File.png>)

## Introduction

In this challenge, we were provided with two artifacts: a disk image `disk.ad1` and a memory dump `mem.vmem`. The story is that a friend ran an executable which encrypted an important file. Our goal is to recover the encrypted file by finding the lost encryption key.

## Step 1: Disk Forensics

We begin by analyzing the `disk.ad1` image to understand the file landscape.

### 1.1. Mounting the Image

Using **FTK Imager**, we mount `disk.ad1` as a logical drive (E:). This allows us to browse its file structure, including any deleted files.

### 1.2. Filesystem Exploration

On the user's desktop (`E:\\[root]\Documents and Settings\RagdollFan2005\Desktop`), we identify two key files:  
* `locker_sim.exe` — The executable, presumed to be the encryptor.  
* `to_encrypt.txt.enc` — Our encrypted target file.

Next, we investigate the Recycle Bin (`E:\\[root]\RECYCLER\S-1-5-21-682003330-706699826-1417001333-1003`), where we find some interesting artifacts.

### 1.3. Recovering the Deleted File

Inside the Recycle Bin, we find:  
\- **`INFO2`**: A metadata file used by Windows XP to store information about deleted files.  
\- **`Dc1.txt`**: A renamed, deleted file.

Using the `strings` utility, we analyze `INFO2` to find the original path of the deleted file.

![Analyzing INFO2](<https://github.com/NEMO246/WRITEUP_CTF/raw/main/Securinets%20CTF%20Quals%202025/Lost%20File/images/3.jpg>)

The output, `C:\Documents and Settings\RagdollFan2005\Desktop\secret_part.txt`, confirms that a file named `secret_part.txt` was deleted from the desktop. Therefore, `Dc1.txt` must be our deleted file. Opening it reveals its content:

**Third Key Component:** `sigmadroid`

## Step 2: Reverse Engineering `locker_sim.exe`

To understand how the program generates the encryption key and what it needs to do so, we perform a static analysis of the `locker_sim.exe` executable using a disassembler (like IDA Pro). The core logic is concentrated in the `_main` function, which starts at address `.text:00401A7A`.

The analysis of this function shows that the program sequentially gathers three pieces of data, combines them, and then uses the result to create the encryption key.

### 2.1. Obtaining the Command Line Argument (`<arg>`)

At the very beginning of its execution, the program accesses the arguments it was launched with.

```assembly  
.text:00401A97 cmp dword ptr [ebx], 1 ; Checks if arguments exist (argc > 1)  
.text:00401A9A jg short loc_401AA6 ; If yes, proceeds to handle them

.text:00401AA6 loc_401AA6:  
.text:00401AA6 mov eax, [ebx+4] ; Loads a pointer to the argv array into EAX  
.text:00401AA9 mov eax, [eax+4] ; Loads a pointer to argv[1] (the first argument) into EAX  
.text:00401AAC mov [ebp+var_24], eax ; Stores the pointer to <arg> in the local variable var_24  
```  
**Code Explanation:**  
\- The program checks the argument count (`argc`). If no arguments are provided, it terminates.  
\- `mov eax, [eax+4]` loads the address of the second element in the `argv` array (i.e., `argv[1]`), as `argv[0]` is always the program name itself.  
\- This pointer to the argument string is saved on the stack in the `var_24` variable for later use.

**Conclusion:** The first key component is the **argument passed to the program at launch**.

### 2.2. Obtaining the Computer Name (`<computer_name>`)

Next, the program prepares a buffer on the stack and calls a function to read the computer name from the registry.

```assembly  
; Prepares the 'Destination' buffer on the stack to store the result  
.text:00401AAF lea edx, [ebp+Destination]  
; ... code to clear the buffer ...  
.text:00401ACB lea eax, [ebp+Destination]  
.text:00401AD1 mov [esp], eax ; Passes the buffer pointer as an argument  
.text:00401AD4 call _read_computername_from_registry ; Calls the function  
```  
**Code Explanation:**  
\- The `_read_computername_from_registry` function (address `.text:00401460`) queries the Windows registry at the path `SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ComputerName\ComputerName` and reads its value.  
\- The result (the computer name) is written into the `Destination` buffer, whose address was passed to the function.

**Conclusion:** The second key component is the **name of the computer** where the program is executed.

### 2.3. Obtaining the Content of `secret_part.txt` (`<secret_part_content>`)

The next step is to find the file `secret_part.txt` in its directory, read its content, and then delete it.

```assembly  
; Forms the path to the secret_part.txt file  
.text:00401C8E mov dword ptr [esp+8], offset Format ; "%ssecret_part.txt"  
.text:00401CA7 call _snprintf

; Reads the file's content into memory  
.text:00401CFE lea eax, [ebp+Buffer] ; Pointer to the file path  
.text:00401D04 mov [esp], eax ; FileName  
.text:00401D07 call _read_file_to_buffer

; Deletes the file immediately after reading  
.text:00401D12 mov [esp], eax ; lpFileName  
.text:00401D15 call _DeleteFileA@4 ; DeleteFileA(x)  
```  
**Code Explanation:**  
\- The `_read_file_to_buffer` function allocates memory for the file's content and returns a pointer to this buffer. This pointer is stored in the `[ebp+Block]` variable.  
\- The call to `_DeleteFileA@4` right after reading explains why we found this file in the Recycle Bin.

**Conclusion:** The third key component is the **content of the `secret_part.txt` file**.

### 2.4. The Crucial Step: Assembling the Final String

This is the most critical part of the analysis. The program uses `_snprintf` to combine all three strings into one, using `|` as a separator. In assembly, arguments for a function are pushed onto the stack in reverse order (right to left).

Here is what happens just before the call to `_snprintf` at `.text:00401D91`:

```assembly  
; Prepare the third argument for "%s|%s|%s" (the rightmost %s)  
.text:00401D67 mov eax, [ebp+Block] ; Load pointer to secret_part.txt content  
.text:00401D6B mov [esp+14h], eax ; Push it onto the stack

; Prepare the second argument (the middle %s)  
.text:00401D71 lea eax, [ebp+Destination] ; Load address of the buffer with the computer name  
.text:00401D75 mov [esp+10h], eax ; Push it onto the stack

; Prepare the first argument (the leftmost %s)  
.text:00401D78 mov eax, [ebp+var_24] ; Load pointer to the command line argument  
.text:00401D7C mov [esp+0Ch], eax ; Push it onto the stack

; Pass the format string  
.text:00401D84 mov dword ptr [esp+8], offset aSSS ; "%s|%s|%s"

; Pass the buffer for the final result  
.text:00401D8B mov eax, [ebp+pbData]  
.text:00401D8E mov [esp], eax ; Buffer

; Call the function  
.text:00401D91 call _snprintf  
```  
**Code Explanation:**  
1\. The **third `%s`** receives `[ebp+Block]` (**secret_part_content**).  
2\. The **second `%s`** receives the address of the `[ebp+Destination]` buffer (**computer_name**).  
3\. The **first `%s`** receives `[ebp+var_24]` (**arg**).

**Conclusion:** The assembly code unequivocally proves that the string is assembled in the format: **`<arg>|<computer_name>|<secret_part_content>`**.

### 2.5. Key Generation and Encryption

\- **Hash Calculation:** The result of `_snprintf` (stored in `[ebp+pbData]`) is passed to the `_sha256_buf` function, which computes its **SHA-256** hash.  
\- **Key and IV Usage:** The resulting 32-byte hash is passed to the `_aes256_encrypt_simple` function, which uses it as both the encryption key and the source for the Initialization Vector (IV). Analysis of `_aes256_encrypt_simple` shows that it uses `CryptSetKeyParam` with the `KP_IV` parameter (`dwParam=1`) to set the first 16 bytes of the hash as the IV.

The encryption algorithm is fully revealed:  
1\. **Key Source:** The string `<argument>|<computer_name>|<secret_part.txt_content>`.  
2\. **AES Key:** The SHA-256 hash of this string.  
3\. **IV:** The first 16 bytes of the SHA-256 hash.  
4\. **Algorithm:** AES-256 in CBC mode.

Now we know exactly what to look for in memory to recover the key.

## Step 3: Memory Forensics

Now that we know the algorithm, we need to find the two missing components from the `mem.vmem` dump using **Volatility**.

### 3.1. Finding the Computer Name

We use the `envars` plugin to inspect the environment variables.  
```bash  
./volatility -f mem.vmem --profile=WinXPSP3x86 envars  
```  
In the output, we find the `USERDOMAIN` variable:

**Second Key Component:** `RAGDOLLF-F9AC5A`

### 3.2. Finding the Command Line Argument

Since the `locker_sim.exe` process has already terminated, the `cmdline` and `cmdscan` plugins yield no results. We use the `consoles` plugin, which scans console input/output buffers.

```bash  
./volatility -f mem.vmem --profile=WinXPSP3x86 consoles  
```  
This command finds the full command line used to launch the program, including our final unknown component.

**First Key Component:** `hmmisitreallyts`

## Step 4: Decryption

We have assembled all three parts:  
1\. **Argument:** `hmmisitreallyts`  
2\. **Computer Name:** `RAGDOLLF-F9AC5A`  
3\. **`secret_part.txt` content:** `sigmadroid`

We combine them: `hmmisitreallyts|RAGDOLLF-F9AC5A|sigmadroid`

### The [[recovery.py](http://recovery.py)](<https://github.com/NEMO246/WRITEUP_CTF/blob/main/Securinets%20CTF%20Quals%202025/Lost%20File/recovery.py>) Script

To automate the process, we use a Python script with the `pycryptodome` library.

```python  
import hashlib  
from Crypto.Cipher import AES  
from Crypto.Util.Padding import unpad

# All key components  
command_line_arg = "hmmisitreallyts"  
computer_name = "RAGDOLLF-F9AC5A"  
secret_part_content = "sigmadroid"

# Filenames  
encrypted_file_name = "to_encrypt.txt.enc"  
decrypted_file_name = "to_encrypt.txt.decrypted"

def decrypt_file():  
"""  
Decrypts the file based on the three-part key.  
"""  
try:  
# Step 1: Assemble the full string for key generation  
combined_string = f"{command_line_arg}|{computer_name}|{secret_part_content}"  
print(f"[+] Combined string for hashing: {combined_string}")

# Step 2: Calculate the SHA-256 hash  
sha256_hash = hashlib.sha256(combined_string.encode()).digest()  
print(f"[+] SHA-256 hash (hex): {sha256_hash.hex()}")

# Step 3: Extract the AES Key and IV  
aes_key = sha256_hash # The entire 32-byte hash is the key  
aes_iv = sha256_hash[:16] # The first 16 bytes are the IV  
print(f"[+] AES Key: {aes_key.hex()}")  
print(f"[+] AES IV: {aes_iv.hex()}")

# Step 4: Read and decrypt the file  
with open(encrypted_file_name, 'rb') as f:  
ciphertext = f.read()  
print(f"[+] Encrypted file '{encrypted_file_name}' read successfully.")  
  
cipher = AES.new(aes_key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv=aes_iv)  
decrypted_padded_data = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)  
decrypted_data = unpad(decrypted_padded_data, AES.block_size)  
print("\n[+] FILE DECRYPTED SUCCESSFULLY!")

# Step 5: Save the result  
with open(decrypted_file_name, 'wb') as f:  
f.write(decrypted_data)  
print(f"[+] Decrypted data saved to '{decrypted_file_name}'.")  
  
print("\n--- File Content ---")  
print(decrypted_data.decode('utf-8', errors='ignore'))  
print("--------------------")

except Exception as e:  
print(f"[-] An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":  
decrypt_file()  
```

Running the script successfully decrypts the file.

## Step 5: Getting the Flag

The decrypted file contains a long Base64 encoded string.

We use **CyberChef** for decoding. Applying the **"From Base64"** operation 5 times in a row reveals the final flag.

### **Flag:** `Securinets{screen_registry=mft??}`
