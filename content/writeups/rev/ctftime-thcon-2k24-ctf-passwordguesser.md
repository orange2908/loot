# PasswordGuesser THCON 2024

## Challenge  
![password-guesser](passwordguesser.png)

## Understanding the challenge  
\- The description suggests that there is a secret hidden in the source code of the password-guesser and secret is given when we give password.  
\- There is also a file password-guesser.elf  
\- Maybe we have to decompile it to get the secret.  
\- Assuming it is written in python lets move forward.

## Solution  
\- To decompile ELF file written in python there is a tool pyinstxtractor so lets decompile it using this tool.  
![decompiler-output](pyinstxtractor.png)  
![dcompiled](dcompiled.png)  
\- Decompiled folder contains many files but we are interested in password-guesser.pyc because it is the main file and it contains the secret.  
\- It is a compiled python file so we have to decompile it also.  
\- It can be decompiled using tool 'uncompyle6'.  
![flag](flag.png)  
\- In the reveal function f1-f13 arranged in ascending order is the base64 encoded flag.  
```  
f1 = "Zm"  
f2 = "xh"  
f3 = "Zz1U"  
f4 = "SEN"  
f5 = "PTntz"  
f6 = "b01V"  
f7 = "Q0h"  
f8 = "fNF90a"  
f9 = "DNf"  
f10 = "RklM"  
f11 = "RV9z"  
f12 = "aVozf"  
f13 = "Q=="  
```

\- base64 encoded flag  
```  
ZmxhZz1USENPTntzb01VQ0hfNF90aDNfRklMRV9zaVozfQ==  
```

\- base64 decoded  
```  
flag=THCON{soMUCH_4_th3_FILE_siZ3}  
```

### flag : THCON{soMUCH_4_th3_FILE_siZ3}
