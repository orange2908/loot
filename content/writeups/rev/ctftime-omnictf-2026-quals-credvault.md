OmniCTF 2026 Quals shipped a reverse-engineering track that runs the full spectrum from beginner constraint-solving to a signal-driven VM that uses `SIGSEGV` and `SIGILL` as branch instructions; in this **CyberSecurity Elite** **OmniCTF 2026 Quals reverse** writeup we walk all four. Four challenges: **CredVault** (medium, 85 solves) is a Parcel-format migration mismatch between two validators over a binary TCP protocol; **Gatekeep** (medium, 62 solves) is a PNG-only FPGA schematic solved as a byte-level constraint satisfaction problem; **Kant** (medium, 92 solves) is a stripped Rust binary whose hidden `check <hex>` mode stacks XOR / S-boxes / MixColumns / power-maps mod 257 / two 16-round Feistels / byte and bit permutations, all reversible from the embedded compare target; **Pusher** (hard, 500 points, 0 solves at release) is a 32-bit i386 ELF whose control flow is smuggled through installed signal handlers and whose `%d` vs `%c` format-string trap costs an entire remote instance to figure out from the wrong side.

Handouts, per-challenge READMEs, and solver scripts live at [Abdelkad3r/OmniCTF-2026-Quals](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/OmniCTF-2026-Quals). This writeup covers the four reverse challenges I solved. The paired writeups on the same event are the [OmniCTF 2026 Quals web writeup](https://cybersecurityelite.com/ctf-writeups/omnictf-2026-quals-web-writeup/) (Ganzir SSTI via reset-token debug leak into Jinja2 `read_file`; StayWild GNU tar `--checkpoint-action` option injection through unfiltered filenames) and the [OmniCTF 2026 Quals pwn writeup](https://cybersecurityelite.com/ctf-writeups/omnictf-2026-quals-pwn-writeup/) (nullshui glibc 2.39 tcache poison over `_IO_2_1_stdout_`; WinCapture Windows kernel-driver `COPY` double-read race).

## The four OmniCTF 2026 Quals reverse challenges#

Challenge| Difficulty| Bug class / primitive| Flag  
---|---|---|---  
CredVault| Medium (85 solves)| Small stripped Linux ELF over a binary TCP protocol. Five commands (load, strict-validate, forward-validate, flag, cookie). Strict Parcel validator checks structure + reversible checksum `p[5] == p[1] ^ 0xca110000` but never restricts `p[1]`. Forwarding validator only checks `p[1] == 0xca110042`. Migration bug: one field authenticates the strict path via the checksum while unlocking the legacy forwarding path directly. Single Parcel satisfies both: `p = {0xca110001, 0xca110042, 1, 0, 0, 0x42}`. Chain: load → strict-validate → forward-validate → flag.| `OmniCTF{d1_532d0a87aa120465_7da960a4f955190182f4f760115accb6_1c52be88d2cf76a2f23f8b80cb756e3b}`  
Gatekeep| Medium (62 solves)| Handout is a PNG-only schematic of a combinational byte circuit. Nine byte inputs `c1..c9`, mixed arithmetic (add/sub mod 256), bitwise (AND/OR/XOR/NOT), and equality comparators against nine constants ANDed into a final `valid`. Solve as constraint satisfaction: start with `c9+c5==0xa5` and `c9^c5==0x41` pinning `(c9,c5)` to a small set, then derive `c1` from `(c1+c5)-c9==0x87`, and propagate through the rest. Verify the byte string matches the published `md5 = 47797f54...`; the flag body is `sha256(password)`. Wire-crossing trap on the `0x45` branch (visual crossings without connection dots are not connections).| `omniCTF{286fc732ff998a04c5660b517df3404b4de58292ae0b3002fd107ecb484f8d70}`  
Kant| Medium (92 solves)| Stripped Rust ELF with a visible shifting-maze game as distraction and a fake `.rodata` flag. Hidden `check <hex>` mode expects 36 hex-decoded bytes; forward pipeline stacks: XOR key0 → S-box(0x63 affine) → AES MixColumns-style diffusion → power map `(b+1)^17 mod 257` minus 1 → 16-round Feistel A → 36-byte Fisher-Yates shuffle A → bit permutation by 13 → S-box(0x8f) → 16-round Feistel B → power map `(b+1)^11 mod 257` minus 1 → XOR key1 → shuffle B → memcmp target. Every stage reversible: `pow(17,-1,256)` and `pow(11,-1,256)` invert the power maps, Feistel rounds reverse without inverting F, SplitMix64 keystream is deterministic. Invert from the embedded target.| `OMNICTF{t1m3_x0r_1s_r3v3rs1bl3_cr4p}`  
Pusher| Hard (0 solves at release)| 32-bit i386 ELF that installs `SIGSEGV` (0x11) and `SIGILL` (0x4) handlers and uses bad memory accesses / illegal instructions as VM branches. Win condition: `hz_sp == strlen(hz_target)` and `hz_stk[1:1+hz_sp] == hz_target`, then menu option 4. Menu reads decimal via `%d`, but push data reads via `%c`: sending `65\n` writes `'6'`, not `'A'`. Slot state machine transitions (slots 0-8) let one lap stabilise exactly one new byte. 50 full laps build the first 50 target bytes, one partial lap leaves the last 4 live, option 4 runs the checker and copies the real remote `flag.txt`.| `OmniCTF{H3ap_1T_a11_L3ave_N0n3}`  
  
The four challenges share a discipline worth stating up front: **read past the visible surface**. CredVault’s second validator does not enforce what the first does. Gatekeep’s wire crossings without connection dots aren’t wires. Kant has a large fake `.rodata` flag pinned next to the real embedded compare target, and the whole maze game is a decoy for a hidden CLI mode. Pusher has a placeholder local `flag.txt` output that will never match remote, and its scanf format string quietly switches between `%d` and `%c` between menu and payload. In every case the trained-triage move is to enumerate the whole binary or schematic before committing to what a single visible pointer _seems_ to say.

## Methodology — every stage is reversible, so invert from the target#

A pattern that worked across every challenge in this set: **when the target of the final comparison is a fixed value in the binary, work backwards from that target instead of trying to guess the input**. Kant is the cleanest example. The `check` branch does a `memcmp` against a specific 36-byte blob in `.rodata`; every transform between the user input and that memcmp is deterministic and reversible; so the input that passes is `inverse_pipeline(target)`. No brute force, no SMT, no dynamic instrumentation past confirming the pipeline order. CredVault is the same shape at a smaller scale: the flag path checks two flags that get set by two validators. The validators check _properties_ , so working out which single Parcel satisfies both properties is the whole exploit. Gatekeep is the constraint-satisfaction cousin: the target is a conjunction of nine byte equalities, and the input `(c1..c9)` that satisfies all nine is recoverable in a few seconds of Python without any solver library.

Pusher is the outlier because it doesn’t expose a target you can invert from. The compare is a `strcmp` against a fake local target in the binary; the _remote_ replaces the flag file, and the fake target’s role is to make the local exploit lightning-quick to develop. The signal-driven VM is designed to make static disassembly look chaotic, so the trained move is to run the binary and _name globals as you go_ : pick a global that changes every prompt, tag it (`hz_sp`, `hz_stk`, `hz_slot`), and infer the transitions dynamically. The `scanf` format switch between `%d` and `%c` between menu and payload is the one trap that will burn a remote instance if you don’t observe it locally first; it’s why setting up the 32-bit loader before spending a remote attempt pays for itself many times over.

Per-challenge walkthroughs follow.

## 1\. CredVault#

Binary TCP protocol reversing. Two validators disagree on which Parcel field authenticates the payload. One Parcel satisfies both.

### Step 1 — Triage#

```
    $ file credvault
    ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, dynamically linked, stripped
```

Full RELRO + canary + NX + PIE. Points away from memory corruption; the challenge is about the state machine.

Strings are sparse:

```
    CREDVAULT_FLAG
    CTF{local_test_only_not_a_real_flag}
```

The service reads `CREDVAULT_FLAG` from the environment, unsets it, and accepts one TCP connection. The local placeholder isn’t the real flag; the remote runner injects the real one.

### Step 2 — Wire format#

The handler reads 8 bytes for `{u32 command, u32 body_len}`, optionally reads `body_len` bytes, and writes a response `{u32 status, u32 output_length, optional output}`. Small Python helper:

```
    def request(sock, cmd, body=b""):
        sock.sendall(struct.pack("<II", cmd, len(body)) + body)
        status, length = struct.unpack("<II", recvn(sock, 8))
        data = recvn(sock, length) if length else b""
        return status, data
```

### Step 3 — Command surface#

The dispatch subtracts `0xca000001` and accepts five commands:

Command| Body| Behaviour  
---|---|---  
`0xca000001`| 0| Returns a 4-byte cookie  
`0xca000002`| 24| Stores Parcel, marks loaded  
`0xca000003`| 0 or body| Strict validator; sets `strict_authorized`  
`0xca000004`| 0 or body| Forwarding validator; requires strict auth  
`0xca000005`| 0 or body| Returns flag if `forwarded != 0`  
  
### Step 4 — The two validators disagree#

Strict validator:

```
    bool strict(uint32_t *p, uint32_t len) {
        if (len <= 0x17) return false;
        if (p[0] != 0xca110001) return false;
        if (p[2] != 1) return false;
        if (p[3] != 0) return false;
        if (p[4] != 0) return false;
        return (p[1] ^ 0xca110000) == p[5];   // reversible checksum
    }
```

Forwarding validator:

```
    bool forwarding(uint32_t *p, uint32_t len) {
        return len > 0x0f && p[1] == 0xca110042;   // literal check
    }
```

The strict path never restricts `p[1]` beyond the checksum, and the checksum is trivially satisfiable because we choose both `p[1]` and `p[5]`. The forwarding path checks a specific magic value in the same field.

### Step 5 — One Parcel to satisfy both#

```
    parcel = struct.pack("<6I",
        0xca110001,   # strict magic (p[0])
        0xca110042,   # forwarding magic (p[1])
        1,            # p[2]
        0,            # p[3]
        0,            # p[4]
        0xca110042 ^ 0xca110000,   # 0x42 (p[5], checksum)
    )
```

### Step 6 — Fire the chain#

```
    request(sock, 0xca000002, parcel)   # load
    request(sock, 0xca000003)           # strict authorize
    request(sock, 0xca000004)           # forward validate
    status, flag = request(sock, 0xca000005)
```

Live output:

```
    OmniCTF{d1_532d0a87aa120465_7da960a4f955190182f4f760115accb6_1c52be88d2cf76a2f23f8b80cb756e3b}
```

Per-challenge README + solver: [rev/credvault](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/OmniCTF-2026-Quals/tree/main/rev/credvault).

The bug class is a migration mismatch. When a binary format changes shape (new fields, new checksum), the old fields sometimes stay live in secondary paths (“forwarding”, “backward-compat mode”, “legacy client support”) that were signed off before the migration. When strict and legacy validators disagree on which fields authenticate what, the attacker is free to satisfy both with a single artefact. Real-world analogues: JWT header/payload mismatches (`typ: JWT+CWT` styled bypasses), Kubernetes `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1` versus `v1` validation windows, PDF signed-content-vs-visible-content mismatches, X.509 SAN vs CN mismatches, HTTP request smuggling primitive as a whole. Any legacy validator that survives a migration deserves an audit against every field the new one checks.

## 2\. Gatekeep#

PNG-only FPGA schematic. Nine byte inputs, nine equality comparators ANDed to `valid`. Solve as a constraint satisfaction problem.

### Step 1 — Read the schematic#

```
    $ file checker.png
    checker.png: PNG image data, 10000 x 13506, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced
```

Ten-thousand-pixel-wide image, no embedded SVG source, no vector metadata. The useful artefact is what’s rendered. Zoom out to catalogue the primitives:

  * Nine byte inputs named `c1` through `c9`.
  * Arithmetic gates: `+` (add mod 256), `-` (sub mod 256).
  * Bitwise gates: AND, OR, XOR, NOT (masked to one byte).
  * Equality comparators against byte constants.
  * Final AND chain producing `valid`.


Constants at the comparator chain, read left to right:

```
    0x60, 0x45, 0xaf, 0xbb, 0xa5, 0x41, 0xb2, 0x87, 0xfd
```

### Step 2 — Watch for the wire-crossing trap#

The `0x45` branch has several long wires crossing near the top-left. Following the visually nearest line makes the branch look like it uses `(c1 + c4)`. Connection dots are the ground truth: the actual expression is `((c1 + c3) + c2) | (c1 & c2)`. Getting this branch wrong produces a plausible-looking but wrong candidate set. Trust dots, not proximity.

### Step 3 — Traced constraint system#

```
    ((c1 - c4) ^ (c1 + c4)) == 0x60
    (((c1 + c3) + c2) | (c1 & c2)) == 0x45
    ((c9 ^ c6) - (c8 & c6)) + (c9 - ~(c1 & c2)) == 0xaf
    ((c7 & ~c4) ^ (c1 + c5)) == 0xbb
    (c9 + c5) == 0xa5
    (c9 ^ c5) == 0x41
    ((c6 & c5) ^ (c9 | c5) ^ (~c5 & ~c6)) == 0xb2
    ((c1 + c5) - c9) == 0x87
    ((c4 & c5 & c9) | (((c1 & c8) & c2) ^ (c2 + c8))) == 0xfd
```

### Step 4 — Solve in dependency order#

The two comparators against `(c9, c5)` collapse first. `c9 + c5 == 0xa5` and `c9 ^ c5 == 0x41` pin the pair to a small set. Then `(c1 + c5) - c9 == 0x87` gives `c1` immediately for each candidate. Propagate through `c6`, `c4`, `(c2, c8)`, `c3`, `c7` in order and enumerate the survivors.

```
    for c9 in range(256):
        for c5 in range(256):
            if add8(c9, c5) != 0xa5: continue
            if c9 ^ c5 != 0x41: continue
            c1 = add8(0x87 + c9 - c5, 0)
            ...  # propagate
```

Verify each surviving `(c1..c9)` byte string against the published `md5 = 47797f54b0f9f4b5b46463e7f86655d5`. Exactly one matches:

```
    c1..c9 = 0x48 0x57 0x66 0x30 0x72 0x4c 0x31 0x66 0x33
           = H    W    f    0    r    L    1    f    3
           = "HWf0rL1f3"
```

### Step 5 — Build the flag#

```
    >>> hashlib.sha256(b"HWf0rL1f3").hexdigest()
    '286fc732ff998a04c5660b517df3404b4de58292ae0b3002fd107ecb484f8d70'
```

Flag: `omniCTF{286fc732ff998a04c5660b517df3404b4de58292ae0b3002fd107ecb484f8d70}`.

Per-challenge README + solver: [rev/gatekeep](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/OmniCTF-2026-Quals/tree/main/rev/gatekeep).

The generalisable pattern: byte-level combinational circuits map cleanly to Python constraint systems. Nine 8-bit unknowns is `2^72` combined, well past brute force, but solving in the right order reduces to enumerating one or two bytes at a time. Same shape applies to any small circuit reversing exercise, including bitcoin-style hashcash puzzles, small hash preimages with heavy internal structure, and hand-written obfuscated password checkers with `if (input[i] * K + M == target[i])`-style constraints. Trust the constants, solve in the order that pins the smallest search space first, verify with any secondary oracle (here, the published MD5).

## 3\. Kant#

Stripped Rust ELF. Visible shifting-maze game as decoy. Hidden `check <hex>` mode with a fully deterministic reversible pipeline against an embedded compare target.

### Step 1 — Triage#

```
    $ file kant
    ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, dynamically linked, stripped
    
    $ rabin2 -I kant | grep compiler
    compiler: rustc version 1.89.0
```

Full RELRO + NX + PIE. Rust binary, so no memory corruption path.

Strings expose the hidden modes:

```
    usage: kant check <hex>
    THE SHIFTING MAZE
    OMNICTF{n0t_th3_r34l_0n3_keep_d1gg1ng}   <-- decoy
    correct, that is the flag.
```

The visible flag in `.rodata` is the fake. The `check <hex>` mode is the real challenge surface.

### Step 2 — Locate the compare target#

The `check` branch decodes hex, requires exactly 36 decoded bytes, and eventually `memcmp`s against:

```
    155df956979abc1b2cc950fc301c3fa7
    a424feb1b7ece49e4c6ea8e9630c2e3e
    9eebb3de
```

That’s the target we invert from.

### Step 3 — SplitMix64 keystream#

The checker allocates `0x2a0` bytes and fills `0x298` bytes with:

```
    state = 0x9EF879A83A2689F7
    x = state
    x ^= x >> 30; x *= 0xBF58476D1CE4E5B9
    x ^= x >> 27; x *= 0x94D049BB133111EB
    x ^= x >> 31
    state += 1
```

Slices are used as:

Range| Purpose  
---|---  
`[0x000:0x024]`| First 36-byte XOR key  
`[0x024:0x144]`| 16 Feistel-A round keys × 18 bytes  
`[0x144:0x14c]`| Seed for Fisher-Yates shuffle A  
`[0x14c:0x170]`| Second 36-byte XOR key  
`[0x170:0x290]`| Feistel-B round keys  
`[0x290:0x298]`| Seed for Fisher-Yates shuffle B  
  
Fisher-Yates seed advances via:

```
    seed = seed * 0x5851F42D4C957F2D + 0x14057B7EF767814F
    idx  = (seed >> 33) % remaining
```

### Step 4 — Two AES-style S-boxes#

The helper generates a 512-byte table: 256-byte S-box + inverse. With affine constant `0x63` the first 16 bytes are the standard AES S-box (`63 7c 77 7b f2 6b 6f c5 30 01 67 2b fe d7 ab 76`). The helper is called twice: `make_sbox(0x63)` and `make_sbox(0x8f)`. So the checker has two AES-style S-box families.

### Step 5 — The full forward pipeline#

```
    input (36 bytes)
      XOR key0
      S-box(0x63)
      MixColumns-style over each 4-byte block
      power map (b+1)^17 mod 257, minus 1
      16-round Feistel A
      36-byte shuffle A
      bit permutation by 13
      S-box(0x8f)
      16-round Feistel B
      power map (b+1)^11 mod 257, minus 1
      XOR key1
      36-byte shuffle B
      memcmp against embedded target
```

Every stage is reversible.

### Step 6 — Inverses#

**Power maps.** For each byte `b`, treat `b+1` as an element of `(Z/257Z)*`. The group has order 256. The inverse of `x → x^k mod 257` is `x → x^(k^-1 mod 256)`:

```
    INV_17 = pow(17, -1, 256)   # 241
    INV_11 = pow(11, -1, 256)   # 163
```

**Feistel.** For `L, R = R, L ^ F(R, key)`, the inverse round is `L, R = R ^ F(L, key), L`. So both 16-round transforms invert by applying the same F with keys in reverse order (no need to invert the round function).

**Shuffles.** Fisher-Yates over indices `0..35` with the fixed seed sequence. Compute the permutation and undo with `perm^-1`.

**Bit permutation by 13.** Undo by rotating in the opposite direction.

**S-boxes and XORs.** Trivially reversible.

**MixColumns.** Standard AES-style invertible over GF(2^8); apply the inverse matrix per 4-byte block.

### Step 7 — Invert from the target#

```
    data = target
    data = undo_shuffle(data, perm_b)
    data = xor_bytes(data, key1)
    data = undo_power_map(data, INV_11)
    data = undo_feistel(data, feistel_keys_b, sbox_b)
    data = inverse_sbox(data, sbox_b)
    data = undo_bit_permute(data, 13)
    data = undo_shuffle(data, perm_a)
    data = undo_feistel(data, feistel_keys_a, sbox_a)
    data = undo_power_map(data, INV_17)
    data = undo_mix_columns(data)
    data = inverse_sbox(data, sbox_a)
    flag = xor_bytes(data, key0)
    # b'OMNICTF{t1m3_x0r_1s_r3v3rs1bl3_cr4p}'
```

Then run the reconstructed forward transform against `flag` and confirm the result equals the embedded target. That catches any mistake in S-boxes, shuffles, bit order, or Feistel inversion before you go to the binary.

### Step 8 — Verify with the hidden mode#

```
    $ ./kant check 4f4d4e494354467b74316d335f7830725f31735f72337633727331626c335f637234707d
    correct, that is the flag.
```

Flag: `OMNICTF{t1m3_x0r_1s_r3v3rs1bl3_cr4p}`. The body reads as “time-XOR is reversible crap”, which is exactly what the whole pipeline demonstrates.

Per-challenge README + solver: [rev/kant](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/OmniCTF-2026-Quals/tree/main/rev/kant).

Two portable lessons. **Long deterministic pipelines against fixed embedded targets are always inversion, never brute force.** When every step is reversible and the compare target lives in `.rodata`, walking the pipeline backwards is strictly cheaper than any forward-search attempt. **Rebuild the forward pipeline as a sanity check.** After computing `flag = inverse_pipeline(target)`, running `forward_pipeline(flag)` and comparing to `target` catches every mistake in a controllable environment (no binary needed). If the two don’t match, one specific stage is wrong; bisect.

## 4\. Pusher#

32-bit i386 ELF that installs `SIGSEGV`/`SIGILL` handlers and uses bad memory accesses / illegal instructions as VM branches. Hard, 500 points, 0 solves at release. The gotcha isn’t the VM; it’s a `scanf` format-string switch between menu and payload that costs a remote instance to discover from the wrong side.

### Step 1 — Triage#

```
    $ file challenge
    ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, dynamically linked, not stripped
```

Unusually old shape for a modern challenge: 32-bit i386, no PIE, no canary, NX disabled, partial RELRO. Looks pwn-friendly but isn’t; it’s a reversing puzzle built around a custom execution model.

Exported symbols are helpfully named:

```
    dispatch, master_loop, applyMove, isWin, loadFlag, win, main
```

Menu strings + fake target string:

```
    1.Good stuff.  2.Tango down.  3.We're on.  4.Dropped 'em.
    It's dark and I'm wearing sunglasses.
    Pressure and time.
    OMNICTF{G3T_R3A1_0N_R3M0TE_B0z0_TH1S_1S_NOT_A_HAND0UT}
    Congrats!!!The flag is : %s
    flag.txt
```

The hardcoded `OMNICTF{...}` string is the compare target for `isWin`, not the actual flag; the real flag lives in `flag.txt` on the remote and is copied by `loadFlag()` on success.

### Step 2 — The signal-driven VM#

The binary registers handlers at startup:

```
    sigaction(SIGSEGV=0xb, handler=0x860d2f4)
    sigaction(SIGILL=0x4,  handler=0x860d380)
```

`dispatch` restores the VM stack pointer from a global and jumps through an indirect target:

```
    080490c0 <dispatch>:
      mov esp, [0x840d240]
      jmp [0x860d2e4]
```

Static disassembly looks chaotic because the program uses invalid memory accesses and illegal instructions as VM branches: the signal handlers catch them, look up the intended target, and jump. Trying to trace the binary purely statically is a waste of time.

The productive move is dynamic: run it, name globals as their values change, ignore the dispatcher noise.

### Step 3 — Name the globals#

Watching the globals at each prompt gives:

```
    0x0880d420  hz_sp        logical stack depth
    0x0880d454  hz_r1First   first-push latch
    0x0880d458  hz_slot      current slot/state
    0x0880d45c  hz_lastPush  previous operation
    0x0880d460  hz_sub       substate inside a slot
    0x0880d570  hz_stk       logical byte stack (data)
    0x0880dd70  hz_target    fake target string
```

### Step 4 — Win condition#

`isWin` reduces to:

```
    hz_sp == strlen(hz_target)
    hz_stk[1 : 1 + hz_sp] == hz_target
    then menu option 4
```

For the fake local target, on success:

```
    Congrats!!!The flag is : OMNICTF{no_flag_file_here}
```

Remote replaces the flag file, so reaching `win()` remotely prints the real flag.

### Step 5 — The scanf format trap#

At the top-level menu:

```
    SCANF fmt=%d dst=0x860d258
```

After option 1, the byte read uses a different format:

```
    SCANF fmt=' %c' dst=0x860d254
```

This is the trap. Sending `65\n` after option 1 writes `0x36` (`'6'`), not `0x41` (`'A'`), because `%c` takes the first character of the input line, not an integer value. Sending `O\n` writes `0x4f` (`'O'`).

Any solver that treats push data as decimal integers works locally under a hand-rolled emulator but breaks against the real binary. Testing against the real 32-bit binary before spending a remote attempt is essential.

### Step 6 — Fix the local runtime#

Running on an amd64-only VM fails with `./challenge: not found` (missing 32-bit loader, not missing file). Extract Ubuntu’s `libc6:i386` into a user-writable dir and invoke the loader directly:

```
    $ ./root_host/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/ld-linux.so.2 \
        --library-path ./root_host/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu \
        ./challenge
```

Reliable local oracle with real Linux signal handling.

### Step 7 — Map the slot machine#

The menu operations aren’t an unbounded stack. State transitions across slots 0..8, one full lap stabilises exactly one target byte. Observed lap:

```
    slot 0: push filler, pop
    slot 1: push filler, pop
    slot 2: push filler, pop
    slot 3: first push -> next stable byte
    slot 3: second push advances to slot 4
    slot 4: pop, push filler
    slot 5: pop, push filler
    slot 6: pop, push filler
    slot 7: push filler, push filler
    slot 8: pop, pop, pop  -> reset to slot 0
```

The three pops at slot 8 rewind state while preserving the deep byte. Repeating the lap builds a long string even though `hz_sp` rises and falls constantly.

### Step 8 — Build the target string#

Fake target length is 54 bytes:

```
    TARGET = "OMNICTF{G3T_R3A1_0N_R3M0TE_B0z0_TH1S_1S_NOT_A_HAND0UT}"
```

50 laps stabilise bytes `[0:50]`. One partial lap leaves bytes `[50:54]` = `"0UT}"` live at slot 8. Then:

```
    hz_sp == 54
    hz_stk[1:55] == TARGET
    hz_slot == 8
```

Menu option 4 fires `isWin()`. The check passes, `loadFlag()` copies `/flag.txt`, and:

```
    Congrats!!!The flag is : OmniCTF{H3ap_1T_a11_L3ave_N0n3}
```

### Step 9 — Run remotely#

```
    $ python3 solve.py | ncat --ssl \
        --ssl-servername pusher-<id>.inst.omnictf.com \
        --no-shutdown -q 30 \
        pusher-<id>.inst.omnictf.com 1337
    ...
    Congrats!!!The flag is : OmniCTF{H3ap_1T_a11_L3ave_N0n3}
```

The `--no-shutdown -q 30` flags matter: `ncat` needs to keep reading after stdin EOF so the final print lines aren’t dropped.

Per-challenge README + solver: [rev/pusher](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/OmniCTF-2026-Quals/tree/main/rev/pusher).

The lesson worth carrying is that signal handlers as control flow are a legitimate anti-static-analysis technique in real malware and packers (VMProtect / Themida / SafenSoft SoftGuard families all use variants), and the intended reversing move is always dynamic. Name globals as they change, treat the VM’s own state machine as the object you’re mapping, and let the binary tell you the transitions instead of trying to reconstruct them from a broken static disassembly. The `%d` vs `%c` scanf switch is a small but expensive trap: solver-development discipline is to always confirm one full round-trip against the real target binary before firing at the remote, and to log the exact bytes going in at each prompt.

## Cross-cutting defender notes#

Five patterns recur across the OmniCTF 2026 Quals reverse track and translate directly into review or triage heuristics.

**Migration mismatches are a bug class.** CredVault has two validators over the same Parcel: one strict (new format), one forwarding (legacy). The strict validator wins the checksum but doesn’t restrict the legacy field; the forwarding validator wins the legacy field but doesn’t check the checksum. When a binary format migrates, every legacy code path that still reads any migrated field is a candidate for the same shape of bug. Real-world analogues: HTTP/1.1 → HTTP/2 upgrade paths that keep header parsing loose, protobuf v2 → v3 wire compatibility with `required` field semantics, ONNX opset version handoffs, JWT libraries that accept both HS256 and RS256 for the same key, gRPC-web fallback paths. Audit legacy parsers against every field the new one validates.

**Byte-level constraint systems reduce to small Python solvers.** Gatekeep’s 9-input, 9-comparator circuit has `2^72` raw combinations but solves in a few seconds when the equations are applied in dependency order. Same shape applies to hand-written obfuscated password checkers, small AES-lookalike toy cyphers, per-character CTF flag validators (`if (input[i] * K + M == target[i])`), and even license-key checks in small commercial software. When the constant table is visible in the binary and each constraint is byte-level, brute force is usually one Python script away.

**Reversible pipelines against fixed compare targets are always inversion.** Kant’s checker stacks 12 stages: XOR keys, two S-box families, MixColumns, two power maps mod 257, two 16-round Feistel transforms, byte permutations, a bit permutation. Every stage is reversible, and the compare target lives in `.rodata`. Walking the pipeline backwards is strictly cheaper than any forward attack. Same class: any custom cipher whose S-boxes / round functions are visible and whose target is embedded (obfuscated crackmes, in-app-purchase key validators, DRM tokens with local verification), any hash-of-transform-of-input check where the transform is deterministic.

**Non-cryptographic reversibility is a design property, not an accident.** Kant’s power map `(b+1)^17 mod 257` looks non-invertible if you don’t recognise 257 as prime and the exponent as a unit in `(Z/256Z)*`. Once you see that, the inverse is `pow(17, -1, 256) = 241`. Any transform that composes standard reversible primitives (XOR, S-box, byte permutation, Feistel round with any F, modular exponentiation with unit exponent mod prime, MixColumns) is reversible end-to-end without inverting the individual round function. The design lesson: if you want a one-way check, use a modern cryptographic hash (HMAC-SHA256, Argon2id), not a chain of reversible primitives.

**Signal handlers as control flow are a static-analysis defeat, not a security control.** Pusher’s `SIGSEGV`/`SIGILL` handler dispatch is a legitimate obfuscation technique (real packers use it), but the intended reversing move is dynamic: run the binary, name globals, observe transitions. Any code base that treats “static analysers can’t follow the control flow” as a security property is confusing obfuscation for authentication. The same pattern shows up in commercial packers, malware VMs, and some anti-cheat runtimes. Defence-in-depth needs a real trust boundary (signature, HMAC, remote attestation), not a control-flow smokescreen.

## Frequently asked questions#

### What is OmniCTF 2026 Quals?#

OmniCTF 2026 Quals is the qualifier round of the OmniCTF 2026 competition, with challenges spanning web, pwn, reverse, crypto, game, misc, and forensics. Flags use event-specific namespaces (`CTF{...}`, `OMNICTF{...}`, `OmniCTF{...}`, `omniCTF{...}`) depending on the challenge author’s choice. This writeup covers the four reverse challenges I solved (CredVault, Gatekeep, Kant, Pusher). The paired [OmniCTF 2026 Quals web writeup](https://cybersecurityelite.com/ctf-writeups/omnictf-2026-quals-web-writeup/) and [OmniCTF 2026 Quals pwn writeup](https://cybersecurityelite.com/ctf-writeups/omnictf-2026-quals-pwn-writeup/) cover the other tracks. Per-challenge READMEs and solvers at [Abdelkad3r/OmniCTF-2026-Quals](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/OmniCTF-2026-Quals).

### How does the CredVault two-validator mismatch work?#

The service exposes strict-validate (`0xca000003`) and forward-validate (`0xca000004`) commands. Strict checks structure (`p[0]=0xca110001, p[2]=1, p[3]=0, p[4]=0`) plus reversible checksum `p[5] == p[1] ^ 0xca110000`. Forward only checks `p[1] == 0xca110042`. The strict validator never restricts `p[1]` beyond the checksum, and the checksum is trivially satisfiable because the attacker chooses both `p[1]` and `p[5]`. One Parcel `{0xca110001, 0xca110042, 1, 0, 0, 0x42}` satisfies both validators, unlocking the flag path.

### How is Gatekeep’s byte-circuit solvable in a few seconds of Python?#

Nine byte inputs is `256^9 ≈ 4.7 × 10^21` combined, past brute force. But the nine comparator constants and the traced equations pin the search space in dependency order: `(c9+c5==0xa5, c9^c5==0x41)` collapses `(c9, c5)` to a small set; `(c1+c5)-c9==0x87` derives `c1` immediately; propagate through the rest. Total search is a handful of nested 256-loops, seconds in straight-line Python. Verify each surviving byte string against the published `md5 = 47797f54b0f9f4b5b46463e7f86655d5`. Watch the `0x45` branch wire-crossing trap: connection dots (not visual proximity) determine which wires actually connect.

### What is the Kant check pipeline and how is it inverted?#

Twelve stages against 36 bytes: XOR key0, S-box(0x63), AES MixColumns-style, power map `(b+1)^17 mod 257`, 16-round Feistel A, 36-byte Fisher-Yates shuffle A, bit permutation by 13, S-box(0x8f), 16-round Feistel B, power map `(b+1)^11 mod 257`, XOR key1, shuffle B, memcmp against embedded target. Every stage is reversible: power maps invert via `pow(17,-1,256) = 241` and `pow(11,-1,256) = 163`; Feistel inverts without inverting F (`L,R = R^F(L,key), L`); S-boxes have inverses; MixColumns is standard AES-invertible over GF(2^8); shuffles/permutations undo trivially. Inverting the whole pipeline from the target yields `OMNICTF{t1m3_x0r_1s_r3v3rs1bl3_cr4p}`. Rebuild the forward transform against the recovered flag as a sanity check.

### Why can Feistel rounds be inverted without knowing F?#

A Feistel round is `L_{i+1} = R_i, R_{i+1} = L_i ^ F(R_i, key_i)`. The inverse is `L_i = R_{i+1} ^ F(L_{i+1}, key_i), R_i = L_{i+1}`. So you compute F with the same key on the _new_ left half (which equals the _old_ right half), XOR into the new right half to recover the old left, and swap. F never has to be inverted; you just apply it a second time with the same inputs. Kant’s 16-round Feistel transforms apply this trick with per-round keys in reverse order for the inverse.

### What’s the trap in Kant’s `.rodata` “flag”?#

Kant embeds a visible string `OMNICTF{n0t_th3_r34l_0n3_keep_d1gg1ng}` in `.rodata` as a decoy. Any reversing tool that greps for `OMNICTF{` will surface it. The actual compare target is a different 36-byte blob elsewhere in `.rodata` (`155df956979abc1b2cc950fc301c3fa7...`), which is the value the checker’s memcmp compares against. Recognising this needs a full pass over the checker function, not a strings-based first look. The decoy is deliberately placed near the fake to make grep-first tooling misidentify it as the answer.

### How does Pusher’s signal-driven VM work?#

The binary installs `sigaction` handlers for `SIGSEGV` (signal 11) and `SIGILL` (signal 4) at startup. Throughout the code, deliberate bad memory accesses (`mov [invalid], reg`) or illegal instructions serve as VM branch instructions: the handler catches the signal, looks up the intended target from a jump table indexed by the trapping PC, restores the VM stack pointer, and jumps to the resolved target. Static disassembly looks chaotic because the “instructions” that cause the branches are not real jumps or calls. Dynamic analysis is required: run the binary, name globals as they change (`hz_sp`, `hz_slot`, `hz_stk`), infer the state machine from observed transitions.

### What is the Pusher `%d` vs `%c` scanf trap?#

The top-level menu reads choices with `scanf("%d", ...)` (integer parsing, whitespace-tolerant). After picking option 1 (push), the byte to push is read with `scanf(" %c", ...)` (single-character read after skipping whitespace). Sending `65\n` after option 1 does _not_ write `0x41` (`'A'`); it writes `0x36` (`'6'`), the first character of the input line. Any solver that treats push data as decimal integers works locally under a hand-rolled emulator but breaks against the real binary. Testing against the real binary before spending a remote attempt is essential; this trap alone accounts for the 0-solves-at-release stat.

### How does Pusher’s slot state machine build the target string?#

The state cycles through slots 0..8 with specific push/pop transitions per slot. Empirically, one full lap through 0..8 (with the specific push-filler / pop / push-real-byte / pop-reset pattern documented in the writeup) stabilises exactly one new byte at the correct position in `hz_stk`. 50 laps build the first 50 bytes of the 54-byte target. One final partial lap that stops at slot 8 leaves the last 4 bytes live. At that point `hz_sp == 54`, `hz_stk[1:55]` matches the target, and menu option 4 fires `isWin()`, which passes and calls `loadFlag()` to copy the real remote `/flag.txt`.

### What’s the broader lesson from the OmniCTF 2026 Quals reverse track?#

_Read past the visible surface, invert from the target when the pipeline is deterministic, and use dynamic analysis when static is deliberately broken._ CredVault’s second validator doesn’t enforce what the first does. Gatekeep’s wire crossings aren’t wires without dots. Kant has a decoy `.rodata` flag next to the real compare target. Pusher’s local `flag.txt` output is a placeholder for the remote. In every case the trained-triage move is to catalogue the entire challenge surface (all strings, all handlers, all validators, all embedded blobs, all CLI modes) before committing to a hypothesis about which visible pointer matters. The plumbing between the visible surface and the actual weak point is where the exploit work lives.

### Where can I find the solver scripts?#

Per-challenge READMEs, handouts, and solver scripts at [Abdelkad3r/OmniCTF-2026-Quals](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/OmniCTF-2026-Quals). CredVault, Gatekeep, and Kant ship pure-stdlib Python solvers. Pusher ships a Python payload generator that pipes through `ncat --ssl` (with `--no-shutdown -q 30` for correct output draining). All solvers reproducible against fresh remote instances. Python 3.8+ is sufficient for all four.

## Closing notes#

Four rev challenges pulled together by one discipline: **when every stage of the target’s derivation is visible in the binary, walk it backwards from the compare target instead of trying to guess the input**. CredVault’s checksum is reversible, so the strict validator authenticates nothing about `p[1]`. Gatekeep’s byte comparators are a small constraint system, solvable in dependency order. Kant’s twelve-stage pipeline is fully invertible from an embedded 36-byte target. Pusher is the outlier because its target is a stack state, not a bytestring, but the same discipline applies: name the globals, observe the state machine, walk the transitions backward from `isWin`.
