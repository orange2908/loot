**VuwCTF 2026** ’s two stripped ELFs, which both hide a short answer behind a wall of _theatrical_ computation. **ilikewords** (100 pts, Easy) wraps its XOR key in `time()`/`srand()`/`rand()` to look random — but the Kaprekar routine it runs always converges to the same integer, `6174`, and that key decodes an obfuscated URL whose path segment _is_ the flag’s variable slot. **dotsbedashing** (100 pts, Medium) packs a rotated Morse alphabet and a rolling `ror32`-XOR target stream that decodes to the inner flag text. This writeup solves both statically, step by step — no runtime, no network, no debugger.

Both binaries and the Python solvers are at [Abdelkad3r/VuwCTF-2026](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/VuwCTF-2026/tree/master/Reverse). Companion posts from the same event: [Cryptography](https://cybersecurityelite.com/ctf-writeups/vuwctf-2026-crypto-writeup/) and [Forensics](https://cybersecurityelite.com/ctf-writeups/vuwctf-2026-forensics-writeup/).

## Challenge 1 — ilikewords (Easy, 100 pts)#

> “Every day is a new challenge. Embrace it.”

A stripped, PIE `libcurl` binary that prompts for a key, checks it against something fetched over the network, and prints the flag on success:

```
    $ file ilikewords
    ilikewords: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, ..., stripped
    $ ./ilikewords
    Please enter a key: guess
     > That is the incorrect key! Please try again.
```

The title screams Wordle — but we never need today’s Wordle answer. The flag is recoverable from the binary alone.

### Step 1 — Read the static landmarks#

`strings` points straight at the interesting data:

```
    Please enter a key:
     > Well done! You have found the key!
    VuwCTF{do_you_like_%s_as_much_as_i?}
    ":"
    vkjmo!54kji1pdhrw~o3}ps2omy4krl{rx3m(49n0umrr      # 45-byte high-entropy blob
    %d-%02d-%02d                                        # a YYYY-MM-DD format
```

Three things stand out: a **flag template with one`%s` slot**, a 45-byte obfuscated blob (the URL the program will `curl`), and a date format used to build the request.

### Step 2 — See that the flag `%s` is not the key#

The `main` flow (at `0x1515`), condensed:

```
    key = gen_key();                            // 0x1b4c
    decode_url(url_buf, key);                   // 0x187a -> writes URL into .bss
    if (fetch_daily(response)) {                // libcurl
        if (compare_input(input)) {             // strncmp gate vs response
            strncpy(local, url_buf + 0x1c, 6);  // <-- 6 bytes at offset 28
            printf("VuwCTF{do_you_like_%s_as_much_as_i?}", local);
        }
    }
```

The critical observation: the `%s` argument is **neither the user’s key nor the Wordle answer**. It’s a fixed 6-byte slice of the URL buffer at offset `+0x1c` (28–33). Whatever URL is built, bytes 28–33 are printed. Since the URL is a `.../svc/wordle/v2/...` path, that slice is guaranteed to spell `wordle`. **The key check is a gate, not a source.** Deriving the URL just confirms the offset — and it’s the fun part.

### Step 3 — The “random” XOR key is always 6174 (Kaprekar)#

`gen_key` looks random but isn’t:

```
    srand(time(NULL));
    int k = 1000 + rand() % 9000;      // random 4-digit int
    k = fix_repdigit(k);               // nudge 1111/2222/... off a repdigit
    int prev = -1, curr = k;
    while (prev != curr) {             // Kaprekar's routine
        prev = curr;
        curr = max_perm(digits(curr)) - min_perm(digits(curr));
    }
    return curr;
```

This is **Kaprekar’s routine** : repeatedly replace `k` with `max(perm) − min(perm)` of its digits. Every 4-digit non-repdigit converges — in ≤7 steps — to **6174, Kaprekar’s constant**. The binary explicitly pushes repdigits off first so the loop always terminates at 6174. The seed is pure theatre; the XOR key is constant.

### Step 4 — Decode the URL with the walking key#

`decode_url` XORs the 45-byte blob with a key that _walks_ ±1 around the seed `6174` on a mod-5 phase toggle (only the low byte of the key is ever used):

```
    # key seeded at 6174 (low byte 0x1E); ±1 with a mod-5 phase flip per byte
```

Applying it:

```
    vkjmo!54kji1pdhrw~o3}ps2omy4krl{rx3m(49n0umrr
            │  xor(walking key seeded at 6174)
            ▼
    https://www.nytimes.com/svc/wordle/v2/%s.json
```

### Step 5 — Confirm the “wordle” offset#

`main` fills the `%s` with a `YYYY-MM-DD` date and then copies 6 bytes from `url_buf + 0x1c`:

```
    https://www.nytimes.com/svc/wordle/v2/2026-08-02.json
    0         1         2         3
    0123456789012345678901234567890123456789
                                ^^^^^^
                                offset 28..33 == "wordle"
```

So the flag template’s `%s` resolves to `wordle`, independent of the date or the network. The `strncmp` gate (5 bytes after the first `":"` in the response — the `printDate`/solution field) is only what blocks the print path at runtime; statically we skip it entirely:

```
    $ python3 solve.py
    [+] key from Kaprekar: 6174
    [+] decoded URL template: https://www.nytimes.com/svc/wordle/v2/%s.json
    [+] URL[28:34] = 'wordle'
    [+] FLAG = VuwCTF{do_you_like_wordle_as_much_as_i?}
```

### Flag#

```
    VuwCTF{do_you_like_wordle_as_much_as_i?}
```

**Two nice tells.** The XOR loop contains two `time(NULL)` checks that `exit(1)` if more than a second elapses between iterations — crude anti-single-step that static analysis sidesteps. And the runtime gate compares **5** bytes (Wordle answers are 5 letters) while the flag `strncpy` copies **6** — that mismatch is the giveaway that the printed substring is a hard-coded window into the URL buffer, not the user’s key. Every day is a new challenge _for the gate_ ; the flag is the same every day.

## Challenge 2 — dotsbedashing (Medium, 100 pts)#

> A top secret encoded transmission has been captured! I bet it says something supeerrr dupeerrr important, if only we knew how to decode it :)

A stripped ELF that reads an inner value, validates it, and prints `VuwCTF{%s}` around the accepted input:

```
    Please enter a flag below!
    Well done! You found the flag :) Please submit the following:
    VuwCTF{%s}
    Incorrect flag, please try again!
```

Since the flag isn’t fully static, we have to recover the inner value the validator expects. The real work is in `check()` at `0x1352`.

### Step 1 — Decode the Morse table (an 8-bit rotate)#

The title — _dots and dashes_ — is the hint. A Morse alphabet table sits at `.data:0x4020`, one 32-bit little-endian word per entry:

```
    bits 31..24  rotate amount
    bits 23..16  encoded character byte
    bits 15..8   Morse length
    bits 7..0    Morse bits (0 = dot, 1 = dash)
```

The character byte is not stored plainly — it’s recovered with an **8-bit left rotate** using the top byte as the amount:

```
    char = rol8((entry >> 16) & 0xff, (entry >> 24) & 0xff)
```

Decoding all 36 entries reproduces the standard Morse layout for `a–z0–9`:

Entry| Char| Morse bits| Morse  
---|---|---|---  
`0x01b00201`| `a`| `01`| `.-`  
`0x034c0408`| `b`| `1000`| `-...`  
`0x02590100`| `e`| `0`| `.`  
`0x04470101`| `t`| `1`| `-`  
`0x0118051f`| `0`| `11111`| `-----`  
  
This table maps each input character to its packed Morse entry; a character missing from the table fails the check.

### Step 2 — Decrypt the target stream (ror32 rolling XOR)#

The expected answer is stored encrypted. The initial key is the dword at `.data:0x40b0`:

```
    key = 0xb1e1e1f1
```

The encrypted target begins at `.data:0x40c0`. For each dword, **rotate the key right by one bit first, then XOR** :

```
    key = ror32(key, 1)
    decrypted_entry = encrypted_entry ^ key
```

The decrypted dwords are packed Morse entries again. Mapping them back through the table recovers the inner text:

```
    the0world0says0hii
```

(The `0`s are literal Morse digits — `VuwCTF{the0world0says0hii}` uses them as word separators.)

### Step 3 — The verifier quirk (compare lengths, not patterns)#

There’s a bug in the comparison helper at `0x1637`. It tests a Morse bit and compares the result against `0xffffffd3`:

```
    shl esi, cl
    and eax, edx
    cmp eax, 0xffffffd3
    setne cl
```

Because `eax` is always `0` or a power of two, it never equals `0xffffffd3`, so the rendered temporary becomes all-`1` bytes of the same length. The runtime check therefore effectively compares **Morse lengths** , not exact dot/dash patterns — which admits alternate accepted strings with matching lengths. Regardless, the intended decrypted target is unambiguous from the full `(length, bits)` values.

### Step 4 — Solve and verify#

```
    $ python3 solve.py
    [+] binary: artifacts/dotsbedashing
    [+] Morse table entries: 36
    [+] initial XOR key: 0xb1e1e1f1
    [+] decoded inner flag text: the0world0says0hii
    [+] flag: VuwCTF{the0world0says0hii}
```

Confirmed against the original binary:

```
    $ printf '%s\n' 'the0world0says0hii' | ./dotsbedashing
     > Well done! You found the flag :) Please submit the following:
    VuwCTF{the0world0says0hii}
```

### Flag#

```
    VuwCTF{the0world0says0hii}
```

## Cross-cutting notes#

**“Random” that always lands on the same value isn’t random.** ilikewords seeds with `time()` and calls `rand()`, then runs Kaprekar’s routine — which collapses every 4-digit non-repdigit to `6174`. Whenever a key derivation _looks_ random but feeds into a convergent numeric process (Kaprekar, digit sums to a fixed point, repeated hashing to a cycle), compute the fixed point and treat the RNG as decoration.

**Follow the flag’s format-string argument, not the validation.** Both challenges print `VuwCTF{...}` — but what fills the `%s` is the real question. In ilikewords the `%s` is a hard-coded slice of the URL buffer, so the elaborate network gate never touches the printed flag. Trace the exact pointer passed to `printf`; a “gate” that blocks the print path is not necessarily the source of the printed bytes.

**Obfuscated tables usually hide behind a rotate or a rolling key.** dotsbedashing uses both: an `rol8` per-entry rotate to hide the character byte, and a `ror32` rolling-XOR to hide the target stream. Bit-rotation of a byte/word by a per-element amount, and a key that transforms (`ror`, `+=`, `^= prev`) between elements, are the two most common homemade obfuscations — recognizing them turns “encrypted blob” into a dozen lines of Python.

**Anti-debug timing checks only bite dynamic analysis.** ilikewords’ two `time(NULL)` guards `exit(1)` if you single-step slowly, but a static solver that reimplements the loop in Python never runs them. When you see `time()` sprinkled inside a transform loop, that’s an anti-debug crumb, not part of the math.

**Read comparison constants carefully — bugs change the semantics.** dotsbedashing’s `cmp eax, 0xffffffd3` can never be true given the operands, which silently downgrades an exact-pattern check to a length-only check. A verifier bug can widen the accepted set; recover the intended answer from the full data, not from what the buggy check happens to accept.

## Frequently Asked Questions#

**Q: What is Kaprekar’s constant and why is the ilikewords XOR key always 6174?**

Kaprekar’s routine takes a 4-digit number, forms the largest and smallest numbers from its digits, and subtracts them, repeating on the result. Every 4-digit number that isn’t a repdigit (1111, 2222, …) converges to **6174** in at most 7 iterations — that’s Kaprekar’s constant. ilikewords seeds a random 4-digit value, nudges it off any repdigit, and runs the routine, so the result is always 6174. The `time()`/`srand()`/`rand()` scaffolding is theatre; the XOR key is a constant.

**Q: Do I need today’s Wordle answer to solve ilikewords?**

No. The flag’s `%s` slot is filled by `strncpy(local, url_buf + 0x1c, 6)` — six bytes at offset 28 of the decoded URL — which always spells `wordle` because the URL path is `.../svc/wordle/v2/...`. The network `strncmp` against the Wordle `printDate`/solution field is only a runtime gate that blocks the print path; it does not supply the printed flag. Statically decoding the URL gives the flag `VuwCTF{do_you_like_wordle_as_much_as_i?}` directly.

**Q: How is the character byte hidden in the dotsbedashing Morse table?**

Each 32-bit table entry stores a rotate amount (bits 31–24), an encoded character byte (bits 23–16), a Morse length (bits 15–8), and Morse bits (bits 7–0). The real character is recovered by an 8-bit left rotate of the encoded byte by the rotate amount: `char = rol8((entry >> 16) & 0xff, (entry >> 24) & 0xff)`. Decoding all 36 entries reproduces the standard `a–z0–9` Morse alphabet.

**Q: How do you decrypt the dotsbedashing target stream?**

The initial 32-bit key is `0xb1e1e1f1` at `.data:0x40b0`. For each encrypted dword starting at `.data:0x40c0`, first rotate the key right by one bit and then XOR it with the ciphertext dword: `key = ror32(key, 1); plain = enc ^ key`. The decrypted dwords are packed Morse entries, which map back through the table to the inner text `the0world0says0hii`.

**Q: What is the verifier bug in dotsbedashing?**

The comparison helper at `0x1637` executes `cmp eax, 0xffffffd3` where `eax` is always 0 or a power of two, so the comparison is never equal. This makes the rendered temporary all-ones of a fixed length, so the runtime check compares Morse _lengths_ rather than exact dot/dash patterns — meaning strings with the same per-character Morse lengths are also accepted. The intended flag is still clear from the full `(length, bits)` data: `the0world0says0hii`.

**Q: What are the flags for the VuwCTF 2026 reverse challenges?**

ilikewords: `VuwCTF{do_you_like_wordle_as_much_as_i?}`. dotsbedashing: `VuwCTF{the0world0says0hii}`.
