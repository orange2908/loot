## Dynamic analysis

Running the binary gives us a simple password prompt:

```  
$ ./rusty_rev   
Please input your password : LETMEIN   
Wrong password, reporting incident to the admin  
```

Running the binary under `ltrace` to see what libc functions are called by the binary:

```  
$ ltrace ./rusty_rev   
\--- Called exec() ---  
Please input your password : gdb error, please reboot the computer  
+++ exited (status 0) +++  
```

Huh, well, looks like the binary has some anti-debugging techniques built-in. We'll have to keep that in mind.

We can also try to run the binary under `strace`. This will probably run into the same anti-debugging checks, but might reveal something about how they are implemented.

I'll spare you the whole output, but once we execute `strace ./rusty_rev`, we should notice a suspicious `write` call, followed by an `execveat`, so let's just filter down to only those syscalls:

```  
$ strace -e trace=write,execveat ./rusty_rev  
write(3, "\177ELF\2\1\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0>\0\1\0\0\0\0\202\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 391616) = 391616  
execveat(3, "", [""], 0x5b92175fbc00 /* 1 var */, AT_EMPTY_PATH) = 0  
write(1, "\n\342\226\221\342\226\221\342\226\221\342\226\221\342\226\221\342\226\221\342\226\221\342\226\221\342\226\221\342\226\221\342"..., 1937

```

Heh, this time we get an Among Us character instead of the "GDB error". There might be some randomness assosciated with the anti-debugging checks. The first `write` syscall writes to file descriptor `3`, and it looks like the content that is written to the file descriptor is an ELF file. This is then executed with the following `execveat` syscall. This indicates a packed binary within the `rusty_rev` binary, which is decrypted or extracted to memory on startup, and then executed. We can use `strace` again to dump the inner executable:

```  
$ strace -e trace=write --write=3 -o inner_elf_dump.txt ./rusty_rev  
```

We now have a file `inner_elf_dump.txt` which contains a hexdump of the data written to file descriptor `3`:

```  
write(3, "\177ELF\2\1\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0>\0\1\0\0\0\0\202\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 391616) = 391616

write(1, "Please input your password : ", 29) = 29  
\--- SIGINT {si_signo=SIGINT, si_code=SI_KERNEL} ---  
+++ killed by SIGINT +++  
```

To convert this back to a raw binary, first grep for only lines starting with ` | `, then remove everything except the raw hexdump, and convert it to binary with `xxd`:

```  
$ cat inner_elf_dump.txt | grep " | " | cut -c 11- | rev | cut -c 21- | rev | xxd -r -p > inner.elf  
$ file inner.elf  
inner.elf: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=cc6c625f81896dbe1bfe2028ae14a6948839c031, for GNU/Linux 4.4.0, stripped  
```

Great, we extracted the inner binary. Let's see if it still works:

```  
$ chmod +x inner.elf  
$ ./inner.elf   
Please input your password :   
```

Perfect.

### Anti-debugging

Let's now take a closer look at the anti-debugging technique within the binary. Once again inspecting the `strace` output, we can focus on the `openat` syscall to find a potential anti-debugging technique:

```  
$ strace -e trace=openat ./inner.elf   
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3  
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3  
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3  
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/proc/self/maps", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3  
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/proc/self/status", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3  
Please input your password : gdb error, please reboot the computer  
+++ exited with 0 +++  
```

The binary seems open "/proc/self/status", which is commonly opened to check for the "TracerPid" line, which is non-zero when a process is tracing the current process:

```  
$ cat /proc/self/status | grep TracerPid  
TracerPid: 0  
$ strace cat /proc/self/status 2>/dev/null | grep Tracer  
TracerPid: 45387  
```

Look at the `strings` in the inner ELF binary seems to confirm this suspicion:

```  
$ strings inner.elf | grep proc/self/status  
/proc/self/statusTracerPid: ST0P175734M3D  
```

A simple fix might be to replace the `/proc/self/status` string with some other path with contains the same content as `/proc/self/status`, but with `TracerPid` set to `0`:

We have to take care that the path that we are replacing the string with is the same length, to ensure that there is not any problems with offsets changing:

```  
$ cp /proc/self/status /dev/shm/XXstatus  
$ sed -i 's/proc\/self\//dev\/shm\/XX/' inner.elf  
$ strings inner.elf | grep /dev/shm/XXstatus  
/dev/shm/XXstatusTracerPid: ST0P175734M3D  
```

Running the binary under `strace` with this patch applied seems to have bypassed the anti-debugging check, as we know get prompted for the password just like when running the binary outside the debugger, and the `getrandom` syscalls have disappeared from the `strace` output:

```  
$ strace -e trace=getrandom ./rusty_rev   
getrandom("\x33\xb4\x9b\xdf\x9c\x8b\x6f\xd8", 8, GRND_NONBLOCK) = 8  
getrandom("\x47\xde\x8c\xb6\xe7\xd9\x47\xb9", 8, GRND_NONBLOCK) = 8  
getrandom("", 0, 0) = 0  
getrandom("\x08\xce\xe1\xdb\x73\x39\x1b\x2b\xbb\x61\xc4\x16\x0c\x4e\x51\x7b\x4e\x66\xd7\x55\xea\x89\x2a\x5e\x64\x0c\xab\xd5\x62\xd0\xd5\x65", 32, 0) = 32  
$ strace -e trace=getrandom ./inner.elf   
getrandom("\x02\x76\xe3\xf6\x62\xbc\x0f\x4f", 8, GRND_NONBLOCK) = 8  
Please input your password :   
```

## Static Analysis

### Rehydrating the binary

We saw in the `file` output of `inner.elf` that the binary is stripped. This is extremely annoying, especially with Rust binaries, where all libraries are statically linked into the final binary.

A great tool for this is [Cerberus](<https://github.com/h311d1n3r/Cerberus>) by h311d1n3r, which automatically finds libraries used inside the binary, compiles them, and then matches their function signatures against the provided binary.

We can simply build the tool inside Docker, and then use it to rehydrate our binary. Note: I recommend installing Rust "manually" inside the container instead of using Cerberus, because Cerberus will install Rust from the Debian repositories, which are usually not up-to-date.

```  
# git clone --recursive <https://github.com/h311d1n3r/Cerberus> && cd Cerberus  
# docker build -f ./docker/ubuntu/Dockerfile-22.04 -t cerberus .

```

Alright, we now have a "inner_resym.elf" binary which should contain a lot more symbols than the stripped binary that we started out with.

### Decompilation

I'll use Binary Ninja to decompile the rehydrated binary. Here's the `main` function:

```rust  
00009020 int32_t main(int32_t argc, char** argv, char** envp)

00009020 struct Elf64_Header* (* rax)()  
00009020 struct Elf64_Header* (* var_8)() = rax  
0000902e var_8 = sub_8434  
00009046 return sub_26550(&var_8, &data_5d088, sx.q(argc), argv, 0)  
```

Just like libc's `__libc_start_main`, `sub_26550` is probably a Rust-internal function responsible for starting the "real" main of the program. So we can safely assume that `sub_8434` is the real main function of the Rust program. This is quickly confirmed when peeking inside:

```rust  
00008434 struct Elf64_Header* sub_8434()

00008457 char const (** const var_b8)[0xc0] = 0x1b600000000  
0000845a int32_t var_b0 = 0  
00008461 int16_t var_ac = 0  
00008467 var_b0.b = 1  
0000847f int32_t var_118  
0000847f std::fs::OpenOptions::_open::h20fd30929551db2c(&var_118, &var_b8, "/dev/shm/XXstatusTracerPid:\tST0…", 0x11)  
00008488 char const (** const* rdx_13)[0xc0]  
00008488  
```

We can see the `open` call at the top of the function, opening the `/dev/shm/XXstatus` file, so this is probably the start of the anti-debugging check we saw in the dynamic analysis section.

To find out where the password is read, let's look for the "Please input your password" string in the binary, and see where it is referenced. The `data_5cfa8` global holds a pointer to the string, and it referenced only once in the real main function:

```rust  
00008d47 var_b8 = &s_Please_input_your_password  
00008d4a var_b0.q = 1  
00008d52 int64_t var_a8_2 = 8  
00008d5e int128_t var_a0_1 = zx.o(0)  
00008d63 std::io::stdio::_print::he9dfbe767523a89e(&var_b8)  
00008d69 std::io::stdio::stdout::h48e25a94a6fcffb1()  
00008d74 var_118.q = &data_600f0  
00008d77 ssize_t rax_21 = _<std::io::stdio::Stderr...:Write>::write_fmt::h9c7d53ac92ac6926(&var_118)  
```

Clearly the password prompt is printed to the terminal at this point. Just a few line below this print, we can spot the following code snippet:

```rust  
00008db7 rax_22, rdx_10 = sub_28460(&var_118, &var_e0)  
00008db7   
00008dbf if ((rax_22 & 1) != 0)  
00008fb0 var_b8 = rdx_10  
00008fd0 core::result::unwrap_failed::h899ed7ab2ccb8159("Failed to read lineWrong passwor…", 0x13, &var_b8)  
00008fd0 noreturn  
```

Looks like `rax_22` somehow contains the `Result` of the readline call. So, even though Cerberus was unable to provide a symbol for the `sub_28460` function, we can assume this function has something to do with reading a line of input from `stdin`. For the next step, we need to know that in Rust, unlike in C, strings are generally wide-pointers. That means they are not just an 8-byte address pointing to the start of the string, but actually contain the length of the string next to the pointer. We'll therefore need to tell Binary Ninja that this variable is actually a 16 byte struct, with two fields. One for the length, and another for the pointer:

```c  
struct RustyString  
{  
uint64_t length;  
char* data;  
};  
```

Then apply this type to the `var_118` variable and rename it to `user_input`. Looking at the references for `user_input`, the following snippet should jump out:

```rust  
00008e1a char* data_1 = var_118.data;  
00008e25 char const (** const data_6)[0x85];  
00008e25   
00008e25 if (var_108_1 != 0x17)  
00008e4f data_6 = &data_5cfe8;  
00008e25 else  
00008e25 {  
00008e27 char zmm0_2[0x10] = *(uint128_t*)data_1;  
00008e30 char zmm1_2[0x10] = __pcmpeqb_xmmdq_memdq(*(uint128_t*)(data_1 + 7), (*(uint128_t*)data_4d040));  
00008e30   
00008e4d if (_mm_movemask_epi8((__pcmpeqb_xmmdq_memdq(zmm0_2, data_4d050) & zmm1_2)) == 0xffff)  
00008ec4 data_6 = &data_5cff8;  
00008e4d else  
00008e4f data_6 = &data_5cfe8;  
00008e25 }  
```

Ok, so there are some scary SSE instructions in there, but they are actually just checking for equality of two buffers. Firstly, I assume that the check `if (var_108_1 != 0x17)` checks the length of the string. Let's just assume for now that `var_108_1` contains the length of the string we entered. `data_5cfe8` is a pointer to the "Wrong password" string, so we can probably conclude from this check that the password is `0x17 = 23` characters long. If the length check passed, the data is checked for equality with two buffers.

As I said, the SSE instructions look scary, but let's look at them in the disassembly and then turn them into pseudocode:

```asm  
00008e27 f30f6f03 movdqu xmm0, xmmword [rbx]  
00008e2b f30f6f4b07 movdqu xmm1, xmmword [rbx+0x7]  
00008e30 660f740d08420400 pcmpeqb xmm1, xmmword [rel data_4d040]  
00008e38 660f740510420400 pcmpeqb xmm0, xmmword [rel data_4d050]  
00008e40 660fdbc1 pand xmm0, xmm1  
00008e44 660fd7c0 pmovmskb eax, xmm0  
00008e48 3dffff0000 cmp eax, 0xffff  
00008e4d 7475 je 0x8ec4  
```

This is already much more readable than the Pseudo-C in my opinion, but here it is in pseudocode:

```  
load_into_xmm0(data);  
load_into_xmm1(data + 7):  
comparison_one := compare_xmm_with_memory(xmm1, data_4d040);  
comparison_two := compare_xmm_with_memory(xmm0, data_4d050);  
if all_msb_set(and(comparison_one, comparison_two)) {  
...  
} else {  
...  
}  
```

So, in words, `data_4d050` contains 16 bytes which are compared against the last 16 bytes of some data derived from our input, and `data_4d040` is compared against the first 16 bytes of our input. Because we assume our input is only 23 bytes long, this should mean that the last 9 bytes and the first 9 bytes of `data_4d050` and `data_4d040` should be the same, which is indeed the case:

```  
0004d040 int128_t data_4d040 =   
0004d040 0f ca 1b 12 65 0f e1 05 22 0f cf 14 36 e8 3c 3a ....e..."...6.<:  
0004d050 int128_t data_4d050 =   
0004d050 a5 e7 f3 3f 8d e1 f5 0f ca 1b 12 65 0f e1 05 22 ...?.......e..."  
```

This probably confirms that the password that we should enter is 23 characters long.  
Unfortunately, as we can also see, clearly the data being compared against is not just the password, but it is masked or encrypted in some way.

However, a simple strategy is to consider whatever masking or encryption is applied as a set of 23 sboxes, one sbox for each index. This essentially considers the masking as a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, based on individual bytes. Because the masked data is hardcoded in the binary, we can probably assume that the cipher is "static".

## Recovering the SBOXes

With the polyalphabetic substitution cipher assumption, we can just recover all 23 sboxes by first using "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" as the password, recording what "A" maps to at each index, then using "BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB", and so on, until we know what each character is masked to at each index. Once we have the sboxes, we simply invert them and then unmask the hardcoded data to get the password / flag. Let's get to work an implement this with [libdebug](<https://github.com/libdebug/libdebug):>

```python  
from pwn import *  
from libdebug import debugger  
import numpy as np  
import string

candidates = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation

# We have 23 SBOXes, each of which maps len(candidates) to some byte value.  
sboxes = np.zeros((23, len(candidates)), dtype=np.uint8)

# Now, for each candidate, we check what it is masked to at each index.  
for i, candidate in enumerate(candidates):  
p = process("./inner_resym.elf")  
d = debugger("./inner_resym.elf")  
d.attach(p.proc.pid)  
# We set a breakpoint just after our data was loaded into xmm0/xmm1  
d.breakpoint(0x8e30, file="binary")  
d.cont()

# Send the candidate for every index  
p.sendline(str(candidate).encode()*23)

# Wait for the breakpoint to be hit  
d.wait()

# Now get the SBOX result at each index  
first_16_bytes = d.regs.xmm0.to_bytes(16, "little")  
last_16_bytes = d.regs.xmm1.to_bytes(16, "little")  
all_masked = first_16_bytes + last_16_bytes[9:]  
sboxes[:,i] = list(all_masked)

d.detach()  
p.close()  
```

Once we have sbox for each byte, we just have to find the character that maps to the bytes of the hardcoded data at each index:

```python  
want = bytes.fromhex("a5 e7 f3 3f 8d e1 f5 0f ca 1b 12 65 0f e1 05 22 0f cf 14 36 e8 3c 3a")  
for byte_index, masked_byte in enumerate(want):  
for candidate_index, masked_candidate in enumerate(sboxes[byte_index]):  
if masked_candidate == masked_byte:  
print(candidates[candidate_index], end="")  
break  
else:  
print("?", end="")  
print()  
```

Putting both parts together and running the script gives us the flag :)
