## hack.lu 2025 CTF - LOKALTAL writeup

02 Nov 2025 \- Popax21 \- cat::[[windows](https://popax21.dev/blog/cat/windows),[kernel](https://popax21.dev/blog/cat/kernel),[pwn](https://popax21.dev/blog/cat/pwn),[ctf](https://popax21.dev/blog/cat/ctf)] 

Two weeks ago I played hack.lu 2025’s associated CTF as part of the Austrian merger team “KuK Hofhackerei”. This year’s CTF also featured a Windows kernel pwn challenge titled “LOKALTAL” - since it was a sponsored challenge, its existence was even foreshadowed to all teams who carefully read the CTF webpage in advance, by virtue of its sponsor being listed as the “Windows Kernel Challenge Sponsor”.

As soon as I became aware of the fact that there was gonna be a Windows kernel challenge, I immediately knew my fate was sealed. Not because this is my field of experience or anything, quite the opposite in fact; I’m usually more at home in the browser (specifically V8) pwn space, or failing that I mostly churn through regular pwn or web (or to be honest anything except crypto, stego or forensics) challenges. However, I did have some unfinished business with the Windows kernel which kept nagging at me ever since Project SEKAI CTF 2024; the hours upon hours of time I sank into its “Process Flipper” challenge kept calling out to me, nagging me to return…

So when Georg, also known as 0x6fe1be2 - KuK’s other primary pwn main, approached me on said fateful Saturday afternoon, having wiped his second Framework Laptop 13 clean to reshape it anew in the cursed image of the Microsoft gods (i.e. he installed Windows 11 on it), with the challenge VM already set up and the patched kernel already loaded into IDA, I knew that I didn’t really have a choice; I knew that no matter what arguments my rational mind would come up with, no matter how often I would tell myself that it was an incredibly stupid thing to do, that I would yet again succumb to the calls of the Windows kernel sirens. So I RDPed into Georg’s laptop (I was not gonna let Windows escape its dedicated quarantine zone after all), took a deep breath, sighed, then locked in as hard as I could, with the goal of this time finally conquering this stupid piece of Microsoft-made software, and …

![Discord conversation of everyone being "very excited" for the challenge](https://popax21.dev/assets/posts/lokaltal-writeup/anticipation.png)

The air was filled with ecstasy over at KuK HQ’s pwn department as people there first caught wind of the upcoming challenge.

… I failed. Yet again. I sank countless hours into it, kept going as the whiteboards at our office-turned-CTF hackerspace started being filled with unintelligible manic rambling, sacrificed too many hours of sleep to the CTF gods, but in the end it was all in vein; I still failed. However, this time something was different - I decided to keep going after the CTF. Maybe it was motivated by having the excuse that the sponsor writeup competition was still ongoing, maybe it was motivated by not wanting to let yet another Windows kernel challenge get the better of me; the exact reason is irrelevant, what matters is that I did. And after another week of working on the challenge on-and-off, we did it. We had finally been successful. Me and Georg had solved the challenge. This writeup will take you on a guided tour how I, with a lot of support from Georg, got there in the end; and who knows, maybe you can even take home some Windows kernel pwn knowledge for yourself along the way.

# Initial foothold

Enough with the (overdramatized :p) introduction; let’s get started with the actual challenge now! The description of the challenge states as follows:

> In this challenge, you will need to exploit CVE-2023-21688, a use-after-free vulnerability in the `AlpcpCreateView` function. We have ported the bug to the most recent version of Windows 11 25H2 at the time of writing. The attachment file contains the patched ntoskrnl.exe as well as the full challenge description, which contains instructions on setting up a local instance of the challenge for debugging. The VM image is linked in the README.md in the archive because of its size (~17GB). You are provided with a ynetd-like interface to the remote, where you can submit a PE file that will be executed with a Low-Privileged AppContainer (LPAC) Token. Your goal is to elevate privileges and read the flag from `\\?\PHYSICALDRIVE2`. Good luck!

Hm. So we’re dealing with an existing vulnerability that was “forward-ported”. Let’s look up CVE-2023-21688 real quick to get a feeling for what we are dealing with here; doing so we can quickly find a [blog post](https://fieldeffect.com/blog/cve-analysis-red-october-one-ping-too-many) by Erik Egsgard, the researcher who originally discovered the vulnerability, which reveals some more details of the vulnerability:

> When an application creates an ALPC port, it can create sections and views for the port. Internally, the sections and views are represented with reference counted objects called blobs. ALPC blobs can be associated with the port they are created on, with the `AlpcpInsertResourcePort` function. When view objects are created, the virtual address they get mapped to is returned to the user mode application. This address can be used to reference the view in future ALPC calls, such as `NtAlpcDeleteSectionView`.
> 
> During view creation, there is a period of time where the object is exposed to user mode but before the reference count is increased. If a malicious application predicts the virtual address for a view and deletes the view object in this window of time, then a UAF vulnerability occurs. Predicting the virtual address for a view is trivial as the same addresses are reused, so an application can create a view to get the address, delete it, and create another which will be given the same address.

Wait wait wait wait, let’s slow down for a second, that’s a lot to take in at once. Let us instead reconstruct this vulnerability step by step, building up to a complete understanding of the above explanation.

First, what even is ALPC? ALPC stands for “Advanced Local Procedure Call”, and it’s an undocumented IPC subsystem of the NT kernel. Don’t be surprised about the “undocumented” part of that description by the way; Microsoft tends to only provide the public with documentation of the operating system’s Win32 “personality”, and not of the internal NT kernel APIs the OS is actually built upon itself.

![Wikipedia's NT kernel architecture diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Windows_2000_architecture.svg)

The NT kernel has a fairly interesting architecture; sadly MS doesn’t really utilize it nowadays, and their most recent attempt at doing so, WSL1, went up in flames.  
(source: wikipedia.org "Architecture of Windows NT", CC BY-SA 3.0)

In the case of ALPC however, quite a few people have already done their best to reverse engineer / document how ALPC works (see [here](https://y3a.github.io/2023/07/25/alpc-workings/), [here](https://csandker.io/2022/05/24/Offensive-Windows-IPC-3-ALPC.html), [here](http://publications.alex-ionescu.com/SyScan/SyScan%202014%20-%20All%20about%20the%20ALPC,%20RPC,%20LPC,%20LRPC%20in%20your%20PC.pdf), just to list a few resources). However, details are still rather scarce and scattered around various blog posts / talks / …, especially once you start digging into specific aspects of the mechanism. For now tho, the following high-level summary is all we need to know to understand the vulnerability:

  * ALPC is a client/server-based IPC mechanism which is used to facilitate procedure calls across process boundaries; it is widely used internally within Windows, and also serves as the backbone of various other IPC mechanisms.
  * an ALPC server starts by creating a “server connection port” object using the `NtAlpcCreatePort` syscall; this port is also bound to a specific name/path within the NT Object Manager VFS.
  * an ALPC client can attempt to connect to a server using the `NtAlpcConnectPort` syscall; this dispatches a new “connection request” message to the server connection port, which the server may accept with the `NtAlpcAcceptConnectPort` syscall.
  * if the server accepts the connection request, this results in the creation of a pair of client/server “communication ports” for the connection; the client/server may use these ports to synchronously or asynchronously send a request message to the to the other peer, which then responds with a corresponding reply message (singular datagram messages are also supported). Both receiving, sending and waiting for messages is handled using the `NtAlpcSendWaitReceivePort` syscall.
  * messages may optionally also transfer object handles / shared memory mappings / … to the other peer; this is implemented by attaching “message attributes” to the message using the `ALPC_MESSAGE_ATTRIBUTES` struct.


In our case, we are mainly interested in the shared memory functionality of ALPC. This functionality allows the client to prepare large blobs of data in a dedicated virtual memory region, which is subsequently also mapped into the address space of the server (and vice versa), allowing for the efficient transport of data across process boundaries. The exact way this is implemented using ALPC is as following:

  * first, the client (or server) calls `NtAlpcCreatePortSection`, resulting in the creation of a “section” object. This reserves some amount of memory for future IPC shared memory operations. Note that a section by itself does nothing, and its contents are not exposed to userspace; it only serves as a backing buffer for regions/views/…!
  * a section is then subdivided into “regions”. The NT kernel uses a simple scanning memory allocator to assign each region object its own dedicated sub _region_ of the section’s backing buffer (identified by an offset and size into the section). One section may in turn act as the backing buffer for multiple regions.

Note that regions as a concept are not exposed to userspace! Instead, a region is automatically allocated whenever a new view is initially created (see below).

  * a “view” describes the mapping of a region into a usermode process’s address space. A new view can be created using the `NtAlpcCreateSectionView` syscall, which first creates a new region of the specified size, before then mapping said region into the calling process in the form of a view, allowing the caller to populate it with data. Views are not referenced using object handles; instead, they are uniquely identified by their base address.
  * a peer may share its view of a shared memory region with another process by attaching an `ALPC_DATA_VIEW_ATTR` attributes to a message it sends through a port. Doing so will create a new view of the same region within the receiving process’s address space, which said process may then use to also access the data.
  * once the process has finished processing the data it was sent it may delete the view by calling `NtAlpcDeleteSectionView`, and afterwards calling `NtAlpcSendWaitReceivePort` with the `ALPC_MSGFLG_RELEASE_MESSAGE` flag to tell the kernel to release the message’s associated resources.

A diagram of the ALPC shared memory object hierarchy, to hopefully help things make more sense.

Phew, that was a lot. However, we should now be able to understand the vulnerability we are tasked with exploiting. As mentioned in the description, the vulnerability is located within the `AlpcpCreateView` function, which is tasked with, well, creating view objects (internally represented by the `KALPC_VIEW` struct). Let’s first take a look at what changes the challenge authors made to this function:

        if ( (*(_DWORD *)&Region->u1.s1 & 1) != 0 )
          Region->ReadWriteView = View;
        status = 0;
        *out2 = View;
        AlpcpReferenceBlob(View);
      LABEL_34:
        AlpcpUnlockBlob(Section);
        return status;
      }
```

The patched codepath inside of `AlpcpCreateView`. The commented out call to `AlpcpReferenceBlob` is where the call was originally located, the highlighted call is where it has been moved to after the patch.

The only change made to (re-)introduce this vulnerability is a single `AlpcpReferenceBlob` call being moved further down the function body. However, by carefully inspecting the additional code that is now being executed before the call, we can quickly spot why this change breaks things. `KALPC_VIEW` objects are refcounted objects, and initially start out with a reference count of 1; this one reference is returned to the caller of `AlpcpCreateView`. Transferring ownership of a reference out to the caller of the constructor is a standard OOP pattern in the C language - the caller will drop it once it no longer needs access to the object it just created.

(sidenote: for the rest of the writeup, I’ll interchangeably refer to “view objects” as `KALPC_VIEW`s; however, in practice a “view object” always consists of a `BLOB` struct followed by a `KALPC_VIEW` struct, and never of just a single `KALPC_VIEW` struct)

However, we need the view to continue to exist even after the caller of the function drops its reference, at least until the view is actually deleted using `NtAlpcDeleteSectionView`! Concretely, this means that the port (or to be precise, the `ALPC_PORT` struct) also needs to hold a reference to the `KALPC_VIEW` object we just created; this reference will only be dropped once we call `NtAlpcDeleteSectionView` / `AlpcpDeleteView`. To account for this extra reference we need to increment our refcount by one, which is exactly why we call `AlpcpReferenceBlob` on the newly born view object. Let’s now briefly revisit the description of the vulnerability we looked at earlier…

> ALPC blobs can be associated with the port they are created on, with the `AlpcpInsertResourcePort` function. When view objects are created, the virtual address they get mapped to is returned to the user mode application. This address can be used to reference the view in future ALPC calls, such as `NtAlpcDeleteSectionView`.
> 
> **During view creation, there is a period of time where the object is exposed to user mode but before the reference count is increased. If a malicious application predicts the virtual address for a view and deletes the view object in this window of time, then a UAF vulnerability occurs.** Predicting the virtual address for a view is trivial as the same addresses are reused, so an application can create a view to get the address, delete it, and create another which will be given the same address.

… and bingo. After the patch we call `AlpcpInsertResourcePort` (which associates the view with its owning port, allowing userspace to delete the view, which maps onto decrementing the view’s reference count by one) _before_ we call `AlpcpReferenceBlob` \- we can release the port’s reference to the view before said reference is even created, so to speak. Remember how our reference count initially starts out at just one? If another thread/core attempts to free the view we just created in the span of time after `AlpcpInsertResourcePort` was called, but before `AlpcpReferenceBlob` gets called, the reference count prematurely drops to zero, resulting in the view being freed; we then call `AlpcpReferenceBlob` on an object with reference count zero (which is a no-op), and subsequently return the dangling view reference to the caller of `AlpcCreateView`, resulting in an use-after-free condition if we successfully win the race condition! This obviously doesn’t work without the patch; without it, the view’s reference count is incremented to two before we have a chance to delete the view, preventing the reference count from ever dropping down to zero prematurely.

Before we proceed with attempting to exploit this vulnerability, let’s first write a minimal proof-of-concept exploit which causes the kernel to bugcheck (also referred to as BSoD-ing). As mentioned in Erik’s excellent writeup, we can easily predict the address of newly created views by simply first creating a view using `NtAlpcCreateSectionView`, remembering its base address, then deleting the view again using `NtAlpcDeleteSectionView`; the base address will be recycled once we create another view. Luckily for us, Erik’s writeup also explains how we should go about triggering this vulnerability past this:

>   1. Create a thread to continually call `NtAlpcDeleteSectionView` with the predicted view address to race the create call.
>   2. Create a section view object with the `NtAlpcCreateSectionView` application programming interface (API).
>   3. Trigger large numbers of kernel allocations to try and reclaim the freed view.
>   4. If the race failed, repeat from Step #2.
> 


Let’s implement this (minus step 3, since we are aiming for minimalism)!

First we need an ALPC port to attach our section to; however, since there’s no requirement that our port is a communication port, we can simply use `NtAlpcCreatePort` to create a new server connection port instead, which is much easier to do. We also don’t need to bother with assigning it a proper NT Object name - we simply pass in `NULL` as the `POBJECT_ATTRIBUTES` argument, which results in an unnamed ALPC server port. This is pretty useless if we wanted to accept client connections, but will work just fine for our needs. We then prepare a section object for creating views; we predict the base address of these views as outlined above. After spawning a new thread which constantly calls `NtAlpcDeleteSectionView` in a loop, we start constantly creating views on the main thread until we eventually win the race condition!

          }
        }
      }
```

After running this code on the challenge VM for a bit, we eventually encounter a beautiful BSoD :)

Ahh… how beautiful…  
(I miss the smiley… :( )

# Taming the beast

So, we can successfully trigger the vulnerability; let’s try to actually exploit it now! Since we’re dealing with a use-after-free we’ll definitely need a reliable method to spray / groom the Windows kernel heap - once we can place our own data on the kernel heap, we can reclaim the dangling `KALPC_VIEW` object, and pwn our way to the flag from there.

However, before we get too deep into the weeds, we should probably first sanity-check some things using our PoC exploit. Our PoC does not concern itself with recovering gracefully once we successfully trigger the UaF, so we expect that we would eventually bugcheck somwehere because of some access violation / heap-related sanity check. Let’s verify that this is actually what’s happening! We run our PoC with WinDbg attached to the challenge VM, and…

… huh. So we bugcheck before we even return from `NtAlpcCreateSectionView`? Inside of a call to `AlpcpDereferenceBlobEx` of all places? That’s weird. Let’s investigate the decompilation of `NtAlpcCreateSectionView` to figure out why we are bugchecking there.

      v15 = Section;
      if ( Section )
      {
        status = AlpcpCreateSectionView(Section, Port2, 0, Attrs2.ViewSize, &View);
        if ( status >= 0 )

          }
          else
          {
            View2 = View;
            Attrs->ViewBase = View->Address;
            Attrs->ViewSize = View2->Size;
          }
          AlpcpDereferenceBlobEx(View2, 1);     // blows up if refcount==0!
        }
        AlpcpDereferenceBlobEx(Section, 1);
      }

```

The codepath invoking `AlpcpCreate[Section]View` in `NtAlpcCreateSectionView`. We immediately call `AlpcpDereferenceBlobEx` with a refcount of zero, resulting in a bugcheck.

`AlpcpCreateSectionView` is a helper function / wrapper around `AlpcpCreateView` which also creates a new region object to back our view. After successfully creating a new `KALPC_VIEW` using this wrapper, we copy the newly created view’s address and size to userspace; afterwards we no longer need our reference to the view object, so we release it using `AlpcpDereferenceBlobEx`.

During normal operation, all of this works perfectly fine; after all the port itself still holds onto its reference to the view object, preventing it from being immediately destroyed again. However, remember how we noted that the dangling view reference returned by `AlpcpCreateView` has a refcount of zero if we successfully exploit the race condition? This results in `AlpcpDereferenceBlobEx` being tasked with decrementing the refcount of an object whose refcount is already zero; the kernel notices this nonsensical request, goes “what the heck is going on here???”, and subsequently falls over and dies.

```
    // num = 1
    NewRefCount = -num + _InterlockedExchangeAdd64(&ADJ(Blob)->ReferenceCount, -num);
    if ( NewRefCount <= 0 )
    {
      if ( NewRefCount ) // equivalent to "NewRefCount < 0"
        KeBugCheckEx(0x18u, 0, (ULONG_PTR)Blob, 0x21u, NewRefCount);
    
      // ...
    }
```

`AlpcpDereferenceBlobEx` would "strongly prefer" if a blob’s refcount never becomes negative.

Welp, this makes life a a lot harder for us; with our current setup (invoking `NtAlpcCreateSectionView` in a loop until we win the race condition), we don’t even get an opportunity to reclaim the dangling `KALPC_VIEW` before we bugcheck. Confusingly enough, Erik’s writeup seems to just ignore this issue, and acts as if we can just perform our spray after `NtAlpcCreateSectionView` returns (what?????), even though we just discovered that we will never actually return from this function in practice (this made me question my sanity “a few times” during the CTF - thanks Erik! c:). So, how do we proceed from here? We pretty much have two options going forward:

  1. continue using `NtAlpcCreateSectionView` to trigger the vulnerability. To not cause explosions, we need to spray and reclaim the dangling view object from another thread right after winning the UaF race condition, but before `NtAlpcCreateSectionView` returns - essentially a double race condition, and if we fail and only win one of the two races, we crash the entire kernel :)
  2. find a different caller of `AlpcpCreateView` to exploit instead; ideally, we want some piece of code which does not immediately discard the dangling reference, and instead holds onto it until explicitly instructed to release it - this would give us as much time to spray the heap as we want.


The prospect of winning two race conditions in a row sounded rather… ominous (no thanks, not interested!), so I decided to instead investigate option 2 and look into what other callers we could exploit instead. Looking into the X-Refs of `AlpcpCreateView`, we can quickly discover `AlpcpExposeViewAttributeInSenderContext` \- what does that function do now? Following some more X-Refs we discover that this is the function responsible for creating views of regions attached to ALPC messages in the receiver process during message dispatching! Looking some more into the life cycle of these views, we discover that this code path is a perfect match for all our exploitation needs:

  * when we send a message with an attached `ALPC_DATA_VIEW_ATTR` attribute, `AlpcpExposeViewAttributeInSenderContext` gets called right away; if the region is not yet mapped for the receiver port, it creates a new view using `AlpcpCreateView`, and stashes the resulting (potentially dangling!) reference away in the `KALPC_MESSSAGE`’s `MessageAttributes.View` field.
  * once the server process asks to receive the message, `AlpcpExposeAttributes` is tasked with populating the outgoing `ALPC_MESSAGE_ATTRIBUTES` struct; if `MessageAttributes.View` is set, it does little more than copying the already created view’s address / size to userspace.
  * and finally, once the server releases the message using the `ALPC_MSGFLG_RELEASE_MESSAGE` flag, the view reference stored in `MessageAttributes.View` is released.


![Screenshot of the `AlpcpExposeAttributes` function from IDA Pro](https://popax21.dev/assets/posts/lokaltal-writeup/exposeattributes.png)

```
      v11 = AllocatedAttrs & 0x40000000;
      if ( (AllocatedAttrs & 0x40000000) != 0 )
      {
        OutViewAttrs = (struct _ALPC_DATA_VIEW_ATTR *)((char *)&OutAttrs[1] + (((__int64)(int)AllocatedAttrs >> 63) & 0x18));
        View2 = Msg->MessageAttributes.View;
        if ( View2 )
        {
          Region2 = View2->Region;
          AlpcpReferenceBlob((int *__shifted(struct _BLOB,0x30))Region2);
          Region3 = (int *)Msg->MessageAttributes.View->Region;
          AlpcpLockForCachedReferenceBlob(Region3);
          v30 = Region3[12];
          AlpcpUnlockBlob(Region3);
          AlpcpDereferenceBlobEx((int *__shifted(struct _BLOB,0x30))Region2, 1);
          Msg->u1.State |= 0x4000u;
          v31 = Msg->MessageAttributes.View;
          *(_OWORD *)&OutViewAttrs->Flags = 0;
          *(_OWORD *)&OutViewAttrs->ViewBase = 0;
          OutViewAttrs->ViewBase = v31->Address;
          View2 = (struct _KALPC_VIEW *)v31->Size;
          OutViewAttrs->ViewSize = (SIZE_T)View2;
          if ( (v30 & 1) != 0 )
            OutViewAttrs->Flags = 0x40000;
          OutAttrs->ValidAttributes |= 0x40000000u;
          v9 = a1;
          v11 = v7 & 0x40000000;
        }
      }
```

The relevant section of `AlpcpExposeAttributes` responsible for filling in the `ALPC_DATA_VIEW_ATTR` struct when userspace receives an ALPC message. Nothing interesting happens in here, however we do need to have a valid `Region` pointer to not page fault.

This is perfect for our exploit! After winning the race condition against `AlpcpExposeViewAttributeInSenderContext` (which we invoke by sending an ALPC message with an attached `ALPC_DATA_VIEW_ATTR` attribute), we have all the time in the world to reclaim the dangling `KALPC_VIEW`. Once we are satisfied with our spray, we can ask to receive the message we just sent from our server port, and if the kernel filled the `ALPC_DATA_VIEW_ATTR`’s `ViewBase`/`ViewSize` fields with our sprayed values, we know we succeeded with our spray; if not we simply retry. After eventually succeeding, we can free our fake `KALPC_VIEW` object at any time by invoking `NtAlpcSendWaitReceivePort` with the `ALPC_MSGFLG_RELEASE_MESSAGE` flag. We also don’t need a separate client/server process either; views aren’t tracked for each process, they are tracked separately for each individual port, meaning that `AlpcpExposeViewAttributeInSenderContext` will still create a new view for our server port even if our client port already has a mapped view of the region in the same process!

Before we can take advantage of this new code path, we need to go on a quick side quest: we’ll need a fully-fledged client/server port pair to be able to actually send messages back and forth - the unnamed disconnected server port we used previously just won’t do any longer. However, to be able to connect to a server port, it needs to have an assigned name within the NT Object Manager’s VFS. ALPC server ports are usually bound to a subpath under the `\RPC Control` directory, so let’s just put our new server port in there as well, right? Just one issue: we lack privileges to interact with pretty much all NT Object Manager paths when running in the exploit launcher’s sandbox, so if we try this we are greeted with a nice little “access denied” `NTSTATUS` error. In fact we encounter the same issue for pretty much all other object path we might try to use instead.

Sooo… are we doomed to stay connection-less for all eternity? Not quite! We can utilize another Win32 API to cheat our way past this road block - named mutexes! When creating a new mutex using `CreateMutex`, we can optionally specify a name for the mutex - another process running in the same session may then call the `OpenMutex` function with the same name to also acquire a handle to the mutex. This mechanism is available even within the CTF sandbox; however, how does it help us? After all, named mutexes / Win32 objects utilize a completely separate mechanism for naming objects, right? Not quite! Let’s use the (undocumented) `NtQueryObject` API to query our mutex’s `ObjectNameInformation`:

```
    \Sessions\0\AppContainerNamedObjects\S-1-15-2-3960773736-3780767970-3854913559-2798057646-1169630001-707034611-3278795493\test
```

Bingo! Turns out named mutexes (and other named Win32 objects) actually live within some obscure subtree of the system-wide NT Object Manager VFS; and contrary to `\RPC Control`, we actually always have write access to this subpath! Taking all of this into account we end up with the following procedure for creating an ALPC client/server port pair:

  * use `CreateMutex` to create a placeholder named mutex whose NT Object Manager name we’ll “steal”.
  * query the mutex’s NT Object Manager name using `NtQueryObject` / `ObjectNameInformation`.
  * close the mutex again using `CloseHandle` since we don’t actually need it - we were only interested in its name.
  * bind a new ALPC server port to the NT Object Manager path we just “stole” using `NtAlpcCreatePort`.
  * use `NtAlpcConnectPort` / `NtAlpcAcceptConnectPort` to establish a client/server connection.
  * profit! :)


With our client/server ALPC ports in hand (phew!), we can now move onto re-implementing the rest of the PoC as described above (we still don’t spray anything - this is just yet another sanity check). And lo and behold - looking at our bugcheck backtrace now, we explode because of the same sanity bugcheck within `AlpcpReleaseAttributes`, which is called because the `ALPC_MSGFLG_RELEASE_MESSAGE` flag was passed to `NtAlpcSendWaitReceivePort`; our new exploit strategy is working flawlessly! :)

```

Let’s implement the actual spray now! For this we’ll use WNF state data objects, a common technique for spraying the paged Windows kernel pool (the same pool our `KALPC_VIEW` objects live in). This writeup is already way too long to be able to get into the details of WNF (._.), however, very briefly put, WNF stands for Windows Notification Facility (WNF), and it is yet another undocumented Windows-internal subsystem which is responsible for dispatching various notifications all across the place. If you are curious about the details you are highly encouraged to check out [this excellent blog post](https://blog.quarkslab.com/playing-with-the-windows-notification-facility-wnf.html) by Gwaby, however only a small subset of its API surface is of any use to us. Namely, we can:

  * create / delete “WNF state names” using `NtCreateWnfStateName` / `NtDeleteWnfStateName`
  * attach data to a state name using the `NtUpdateWnfStateData` function
  * read back the data currently attached to a state name using `NtQueryWnfStateData`


Internally, WNF state data is stored inside variable-sized allocations on the paged kernel pool prefixed with the `WNF_STATE_DATA` struct:

```
    // taken from the excellent `vergiliusproject.com` <3
    
    //0x10 bytes (sizeof)
    struct _WNF_STATE_DATA
    {
        struct _WNF_NODE_HEADER Header;     //0x0
        ULONG AllocatedSize;                //0x4
        ULONG DataSize;                     //0x8
        ULONG ChangeStamp;                  //0xc
    }; 
```

This convenient structure allows us to easily spray data on the kernel’s heap by simply stockpiling a bunch of WNF state names, then attaching our spray data to said names using `NtUpdateWnfStateData`. This will trigger the allocation of a `0x10 + data_sz`-sized chunk of memory whose contents we almost fully control - perfect for reclaiming our dangling `KALPC_VIEW` object!

So let’s do just that! After adapting some code from [this blog post](https://whereisk0shl.top/post/break-me-out-of-sandbox-in-old-pipe-cve-2022-22715-windows-dirty-pipe#toc_10) by k0shl, I quickly had a WNF based heap spray up and running. Running it, and…

… nothing. I just couldn’t get the spray to work reliably. No matter what I tried, it always kept crashing with the same code `0x00000018` bugcheck inside of `AlpcpDereferenceBlobEx`, clearly indicating that the spray wasn’t working. I tried tweaking the spray in a bunch of different ways, I tried pivoting to different spray techniques, yet nothing was producing any actual results. Increasing the number of sprayed WNF objects did nothing except shrink the race window down even further. During the entire CTF, I had a total of three (!) successful sprays, sprinkled across hours of agony of trying to get things to actually work properly.

This is where things continued to stand as the CTF drew to a close. To say I was demotivated would be a bit of an understatement; I spent almost 30h of an 48 hour CTF contributing absolutely nothing of value to the rest of the team. I went home in a pretty depressed mood, but even then I still couldn’t get myself to let go of the challenge mentally…

A few days pass, and I finally have the time to take a fresh look at the challenge. I spoke a bit with Georg in the interim, and he suggested some ways to improve the exploit to hopefully increase the odds of a successful run; namely, he suggested pinning a “busy-work” thread to the same core as the main thread while we’re trying to exploit the race condition, as well as adjusting scheduler priorities to increase the size of the race window. So I sat down, RDPed into Georg’s laptop once more (we set up a WireGuard so I could still connect to it) - and immediately facepalmed once I saw my own exploit code again.

See, I had already experimented with some potential improvements during the CTF; namely, I pinned the main thread and the view-deleting thread to a different CPU cores. However, the function I used to implement this was `SetProcessAffinityMask`. Let’s take a brief glance at the relevant documentation, shall we?

> Sets a processor affinity mask for the threads of the specified process.
> 
> A process affinity mask is a bit vector in which each bit represents a logical processor on which the threads of the process are allowed to run. The value of the process affinity mask must be a subset of the system affinity mask values obtained by the GetProcessAffinityMask function. A process is only allowed to run on the processors configured into a system. Therefore, the process affinity mask cannot specify a 1 bit for a processor when the system affinity mask specifies a 0 bit for that processor.

Wait, why is “threads” plural here? Well, because it sets the process-wide affinity mask for **_all_** threads, duh! The function I should have been using instead is helpfully called `SetThreadAffinityMask` \- no clue how I missed that during the CTF. So yea, instead of pinning the two threads to different cores, silly little me instead pinned them both to the same core, kneecapping the concurrency of the exploit - yaaaayyy! I swapped out all my calls to `SetProcessAffinityMask` with calls to `SetThreadAffinityMask`, and…

… the spray started working pretty much every single attempt…

* * *

So yeah, that was a fun lesson to learn… and that’s one mistake I’ll definitely never make again in the future! ^~^

Even now I still don’t know how on earth this mistake was even been able to diminish the effectiveness of the heap spray. Using our new method of triggering the vulnerability, we should have had as much time to spray objects as we needed after all… oh well…

Either way, time to piece my motivation back together, and to get back to solving the actual challenge…

# Heap acrobatics

Now that we finally have a working spray (sigh…), we can continue developing the exploit. Our current setup allows us to free an arbitrary fake `KALPC_VIEW`, so let’s take a look at what that allows us to do:

![Screenshot of the `AlpcViewDestroyProcedure` function from IDA Pro](https://popax21.dev/assets/posts/lokaltal-writeup/viewdtor.png)

(Shortened) Decompiled Code

```
      Region = View->Region;
      Process = KeGetCurrentThread()->ApcState.Process;
      if ( Region )
      {
        AlpcpLockForCachedReferenceBlob((int *__shifted(struct _BLOB,0x30))View->Region);
        View->ViewListEntry.Blink->Flink = View->ViewListEntry.Flink;
        View->ViewListEntry.Flink->Blink = View->ViewListEntry.Blink;
        v5 = Region->NumberOfViews - 1;
        Region->NumberOfViews = v5;
        if ( (*(_DWORD *)&View->u1.s1 & 4) == 0 )
        {
          s1 = Region->u1.s1;
          if ( (*(_BYTE *)&s1 & 1) != 0 )
          {
            Region->ReadWriteView = 0;
            ReadOnlyView = (int *)Region->ReadOnlyView;
            if ( ReadOnlyView )
            {
              AlpcpRestoreWriteAccess(Region->ReadOnlyView);
            }
            else if ( !v5 )
            {

            }
          }
        }
        AlpcpUnlockBlob((int *__shifted(struct _BLOB,0x30))Region);
    
        // ...

          ExfTryToWakePushLock(v19);
        KeAbPostRelease((ULONG_PTR)v19);
        ObfDereferenceObjectWithTag(*p_OwnerProcess, 0x63706C41u);
      }
      return 0;
```

A screenshot of the decompilation of `AlpcViewDestroyProcedure`. There’s a ton of stuff going on, however of most interest to us are the unlink operations.

Phew! That’s a lot of code! However, we can spot some linked list unlink operations - these pretty much give us an arbitrary write primitive (with some restrictions). Right now that doesn’t help us much tho; we first need to figure out where to write to, i.e. we need to leak some kernel object’s address. Georg had in the mean time developed a POC which could leak the NT kernel’s base address using an EntryBleed/prefetch sidechannel, which we could have used to defeat KASLR without a leak, but I really really didn’t want to end up having to rely on a flaky sidechannel for that either…

Oh and as a quick side note: turns out we also don’t need to deal with all of this complexity in the destructor if we don’t want to either; we can change our fake view’s `ResourceType` field (found in the `BLOB` struct preceding the `KALPC_VIEW` struct) to invoke a bunch of other ALPC-related destructor functions instead of `AlpcViewDestroyProcedure`. Sadly none of these destructors contain any exploitable logic not seen within the view destructor, but they are at least easier to survive with a fake ALPC object.

Either way, my first attempt at pushing this exploit further was to exploit the “dynamic lookaside” feature of the Windows kernel heap - this is pretty much equivalent to glibc’s tcache feature, in that it keeps a small stash of chunks in a lookaside list to be able to more quickly serve some allocation requests (see [this excellent paper](https://www.sstic.org/media/SSTIC2020/SSTIC-actes/pool_overflow_exploitation_since_windows_10_19h1/SSTIC2020-Article-pool_overflow_exploitation_since_windows_10_19h1-bayet_fariello.pdf) for details; almost all most of my Windows kernel heap knowledge is taken from it!). My idea was to exploit one of the various dereference operations in the destructors at our disposal to free a fake kernel heap chunk which is actually located in userland memory (the Windows kernel does not utilize SMAP, so such shenanigans are possible in theory). The fake kernel heap chunk would end up on the dynamic lookaside list, and we could subsequently trick the kernel into allocating some important object within reach of our exploit code. However, this idea died a quick death thanks to short but effective security/sanity check found at the start of `ExFreePoolWithTag`…

![Screenshot of the start of the `ExFreePoolWithTag` function from IDA Pro](https://popax21.dev/assets/posts/lokaltal-writeup/free-sec-check.png)

"Kernel sagt nein… :c" (security check in `ExFreePoolWithTag`)

So, since there’s nothing really exploitable within any of the destructor functions we can call, are we just screwed? No, we just need to think a bit outside of the box! Let’s think about what happens when setup our fake `KALPC_VIEW` to just survive its own destruction without attempting to pull any fancy tricks: our dangling `MessageAttributes.View` reference is gone now, however now one of our `WNF_STATE_DATA` objects is dangling! We can reclaim it by spraying some other kernel object of our choice with the same size; once that’s done we should be able to read back / modify the object’s data using `NtQueryWnfStateData` / `NtUpdateWnfStateData`. That sounds a lot more exploitable than the blind unlink/write primitive we had before!

Let’s try this! We’ll spray `KALPC_VIEW` objects using `NtAlpcCreateSectionView` (note that we are doing this solely to spray view object and not to exploit the original UaF vulnerability, so we don’t need to worry about hitting the bugcheck that gave us so many troubles before). Once we’ve sprayed a satisfactory number of views we attempt to read back the view object’s data from the kernel by calling `NtQueryWnfStateData` on all our sprayed WNF objects, and…

… we crash - huh?!? Investigating the crash a bit further it starts to become clear what’s going wrong: we are indeed successfully reclaiming the dangling WNF state data object, but in the process we are corrupting its `WNF_STATE_DATA` header, filling it with garbage values (namely it gets overwritten by the `BLOB.ResourceList` linked list entry). This results in the kernel attempting to read back _way_ too much data, meaning we quickly page fault once we exit the bounds of the kernel heap.

Yet again we encounter a dead end… except once again we can claw our way back out if it by applying some ingenuity. While it is true that we corrupted the `WNF_STATE_DATA` header’s `DataSize` field, which means we attempt to read back way too much data when we call `NtQueryWnfStateData`, we also corrupted the `AllocatedSize` field - this in turn makes the kernel think that it allocated way more memory for holding WNF state data than it actually did, which in turn allows us to write more data using `NtUpdateWnfStateData` than the allocation can actually hold, resulting in a kernel heap buffer overflow!

So, what are gonna do with this BOF? Well, we overwrite the next chunk’s `WNF_STATE_DATA` header with more sane, yet still enlarged values! Because we are dealing with objects of size `0x90` (`= sizeof(BLOB) + sizeof(KALPC_VIEW)`) here, we don’t need to worry much about the heap layout. The Windows kernel utilizes the Low Fragmentation Heap (LFH) to service allocation requests of this size, which basically is a slab allocator / an array of just allocations with our exact size. All pool allocations are preceded with a `POOL_HEADER` struct we need to reconstruct, but this is an easy hurdle to overcome since most of its fields are actually unused nowadays (please see [the earlier paper](https://www.sstic.org/media/SSTIC2020/SSTIC-actes/pool_overflow_exploitation_since_windows_10_19h1/SSTIC2020-Article-pool_overflow_exploitation_since_windows_10_19h1-bayet_fariello.pdf) if you want to learn more about the details of the LFH / `POOL_HEADER` struct). Once we have performed our BOF, we once again iterate over all our WNF state names to figure out which one we corrupted - afterwards we can free the remaining WNF spray, as we no longer have a use for it.

With all the acrobatics we performed until now, we have now acquired a corrupted `WNF_STATE_DATA` object granting us a linear heap out-of-bounds read/write primitive we can use to attack objects of size `0x90` stored in heap chunks located after our own. We once again spray `KALPC_VIEW` objects to place one of them behind our corrupted WNF state data chunk, giving us read / write access to a fully operational `KALPC_VIEW` struct! >:)

![Diagram illustrating the heap exploitation described above](https://popax21.dev/assets/posts/lokaltal-writeup/heap-acrobatics.svg)

"If it ain’t broken, don’t fix it" \- even if it’s overcomplicated :p  
(note that a "view object" actually consists of both a `BLOB` and a `KALPC_VIEW` struct in practice)

# `TOKEN` tomfoolery

Now that we have full control over a `KALPC_VIEW` view object, we are immediately granted a very powerful leak in the form of the `OwnerProcess` pointer. This points to our exploit process’ `EPROCESS` struct - the central nexus of Windows processes. Crucially for us, the `EPROCESS` struct also holds a reference to our process’ `TOKEN`, which we’ll need to manipulate to actually escalate our privileges, so getting handed its address practically for free is a sign that fortune is finally shifting in our favor after all the hardship we went through to even get to this point… u-u

However, even though we have now gained knowledge of our `EPROCESS` struct’s address, we still lack an arbitrary read primitive - we currently only have access to an arbitrary write primitive by exploiting the unlink operations in the view destructor. This was the moment when some feelings of deja-vu set in - I was in exactly this situation once before already! I’m talking about SekaiCTF 2024’s ProcessFlipper challenge: it featured a vulnerable driver which allowed us to write to arbitrary `EPROCESS` fields, however without any read primitives to go along with it - quite similar to our current dilemma! While I did not solve the challenge back then, I did read a few writeups about how others solved it, and the solution they used back then can also help us out here - I’m talking about the `DiskCounters` field!

To briefly summarize, the `DiskCounters` field holds a pointer to a `PROCESS_DISK_COUNTERS` struct, which holds various counters keeping track of the number of bytes read / written to disk by this process, in addition to the number of various performed IO operations. We can read back these counters by invoking `NtQuerySystemInformation` with the (yet again undocumented) `SystemProcessInformation` argument.

```
    //0x28 bytes (sizeof)
    struct _PROCESS_DISK_COUNTERS
    {
        ULONGLONG BytesRead;                //0x0
        ULONGLONG BytesWritten;             //0x8
        ULONGLONG ReadOperationCount;       //0x10
        ULONGLONG WriteOperationCount;      //0x18
        ULONGLONG FlushOperationCount;      //0x20
    }; 
```

The `PROCESS_DISK_COUNTERS` struct in question  
(once again taken from the amazing [VergiliusProject](https://vergiliusproject.com) <3)

However, we can exploit this rather innocent set of metrics by overwriting our `EPROCESS`’s `DiskCounters` pointer to point to some arbitrary address we want to read from. By corrupting one of our victim view’s linked list entries and subsequently freeing the view using `NtAlpcDeleteSectionView`, we can write the address of our `EPROCESS`’s `TOKEN` pointer into `DiskCounters`, resulting in us being able to leak said token pointer by querying our own process’ disk I/O statistics! Additionally, after corrupting our `DiskCounters` fields like this, we will spray more `KALPC_VIEW` objects right away to immediately reclaim the freed view’s heap chunk - this way we can perform more arbitrary writes to actually escalate our privileges later.

We need to be careful though, since even just regular execution of our exploit will slowly corrupt whatever fields are overlapped by our fake `PROCESS_DISK_COUNTERS` struct’s `BytesRead` / `ReadOperationCount` fields - we can counteract this by ensuring our `TOKEN` pointer is overlapping e.g. `WriteOperationCount` instead, while also ensuring all the other corrupted fields are non-critical.

With the address of our process’s `TOKEN` in hand, we can now move onto escalating our privileges! For those unfamiliar with the concept of tokens, in Windows each process is equipped with an “access token” which holds information like the user / group the program is executing as, as well as various other privileges and access-control related information. Right now our token is a highly sandboxed AppContainer token, which prevents us from reading the flag from `\\?\PHYSICALDRIVE2`; however, with the ability to modify our `TOKEN` struct, we can change this now. :)

At first I opted for the classic `SeDebugPrivilege` strategy for privilege escalation. To heavily summarize the strategy: we modify our `TOKEN`’s `Privileges` field (which stores various bitmasks related to privileges) so that we acquire the `SeDebugPrivilege` privilege. NT’s privileges are similar to Linux’s capabilities - here `SeDebugPrivilege` gives us the right to debug any process we want to on the system, including privileged operating system processes. Once we acquire this privilege we can use `OpenProcessHandle` to acquire a `HANDLE` to such a privileged system process (we need to brute force the PID of one since we are stuck within our AppContainer sandbox and can’t enumerate processes, but oh well… ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯); then we can use `OpenProcessToken` to steal the process’ highly privileged `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` token!

… in theory at least. In practice we are immediately hit with a `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` error, even though our token pretty much has all the privileges it can have. What’s going on?!?!???

![Screenshot of WinDbg inspecting a token with a lot of NT privileges enabled](https://popax21.dev/assets/posts/lokaltal-writeup/privileged-token.png)

All the privileges we gained… v-v

![Screenshot of the exploit failing with `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`](https://popax21.dev/assets/posts/lokaltal-writeup/privileged-token-error.png)

… yet it’s not enough?!?!?!??? >:CCC

This had me stumped for quite some time; however, at some point I decided to compare the token our exploit is given by the launcher to a genuine `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` token, just to see if I could spot any other differences that might cause this issue.

![Comparison of the CTF sandbox token to a NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM token using WinDbg; they are mostly identical](https://popax21.dev/assets/posts/lokaltal-writeup/token-comparison.png)

Hmmm… those tokens look quite similar, don’t they?

Huh?!?!??? Those tokens are almost identical! Like, our “Low-Privileged AppContainer (LPAC) Token” (to quote the challenge description) has the user / group SID of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`?!?

… so yeah. Turns out the sandboxed launcher they use for this challenge is a bit crap, and runs our exploit with a token belonging to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. The launcher is open source actually, and it does even have support for impersonating a lower-privileged user before creating the AppContainer - this support is just `#ifdef`-ed out :p

Well why can’t we read the flag then, you might ask? Well, because we have an AppContainer (previously called a LowBox) token! Seems like our `TokenFlags` are a bit different than those of a non-LowBox token… Let’s change them back manually to what we expect from a regular token using WinDbg, just for testing purposes - aaannnd we can read the flag. :)))

As the (not-so-)great Austrian politician Sebastian Kurz once said:  
"I don’t want to anymore, I can’t do it anymore, I can’t stand it all any longer >.<"

Well that was a bit frustrating to figure out… However, that was also the last piece of the puzzle we were missing. After tweaking the exploit to overwrite the `TokenFlags` field instead of the `Privileges` field, we can successfully read the flag! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

# Conclusion

All in all, this was a very fun challenge; I learnt a lot about NT kernel internals, even though the challenge did drive me rather close to insanity quite a few times while I was working on it (you might have been able to already tell by now). The fact it also featured an existing real-world CVE instead of some made up vulnerability made the challenge even more fun to work on. Props once again to the challenge authors for crafting such a beautiful challenge! :)

However, if I was to give one recommendation for next year’s Windows kernel challenge, then please choose any type of vulnerability other than a race condition; the frustration of dealing with an unpredictable, essentially random yet still crucial part of the exploit chain during an already intense 48h CTF is quite stressful, and it definitely made me lose my mind a few times. >~<

And last but not least, huge thanks to Georg / 0x6fe1be2 for helping me out a ton while I was working on the challenge; not only did he lend his second laptop to the effort, he also prepared the entire testing / debugging setup I used during and after the CTF, he was fine with me RDPing into his machine even after the CTF was over to continue work on the challenge, and he constantly gave helpful me tips / insights using his huge Linux kernel / general pwn expertise. Thanks Georg <3
