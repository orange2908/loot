## Synopsis
In the twilight archives of Eldoria, Nyla studies an image of an ancient Celtic cross. Her enchanted crystals illuminate the intricate carvings as she searches through forgotten tomes. The cross stands at a crossroads of realms and time, its weathered surface telling tales older than Eldoria itself. As her magical threads of knowledge connect across centuries, the true name of the monument emerges in glowing script before her eyes. Another mystery solved by the realm's most skilled information seeker, who knows that even stone can speak to those who know how to listen.

## Description
Throughout history, many ancient Celtic crosses have been erected, each carrying cultural and religious significance. However, not all of them are the same. By analyzing the given image and searching carefully, you will find that this cross holds a name of great importance.

## Steps to Solve:
1. **Reverse-search** the image to locate its general historical site.
2. **Identify** the exact name of the cross by verifying similar images.

This task requires basic **OSINT** and **visual comparison** skills—spot the differences, confirm the location, and retrieve the name.

## Skills Required:
Internet Search & OSINT Basics  
Reverse Image Searching  
Analyzing Historical Monuments  

## Skills Learned:
How to refine search queries based on partial matches  
How to identify historical artifacts with OSINT techniques  
How to verify information using multiple sources  

## Enumeration
### Step 1: Reverse Search the Image
Start by uploading the provided image to **Google Reverse Image Search** or a similar tool. The results will lead to various historical websites and image archives referencing **Celtic high crosses in Ireland**. However, they won’t immediately display the exact match.

### Step 2: Identifying the Exact Cross
By cross-referencing different sources, participants will notice that not all crosses in the search results match the given image. The key here is to **compare the carvings and structure** with other high crosses found at the same historical site.

### Step 3: Confirm the Name
By carefully analyzing the details, they will discover that the cross in the image is known as **Muiredach's High Cross**, one of the most famous Celtic crosses in Ireland.
