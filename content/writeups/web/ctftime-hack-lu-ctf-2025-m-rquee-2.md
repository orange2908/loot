### Step 1: Initial Analysis and Vulnerability Discovery

The challenge provides the source code for a Chrome extension, "TagDeprecater," and a link to an admin bot. The goal is to craft a URL that, when visited by the bot, exploits the extension to steal a flag from a local server at `http://localhost:1337`.

An analysis of the extension's source code reveals a chain of three critical vulnerabilities:

1\. **Extension ID Leak:** In `content.js`, the script replaces deprecated HTML tags with a default string that includes an image: ``![](https://ctftime.org/${chrome.runtime.getURL\('no_entry.png'\)})``. The `chrome.runtime.getURL()` function resolves to a full path like `chrome-extension://[EXTENSION_ID]/no_entry.png`. When this is injected into the page, the page's own JavaScript can read this URL and leak the extension's unique ID.

2\. **Insecure Message Listener:** The `popup.js` script sets up a message listener with `window.addEventListener("message", ...)`. Crucially, it does not validate the origin of incoming messages. This allows any website to embed the `popup.html` page in an `iframe` and send it malicious commands via `postMessage`.

3\. **DOM-based XSS:** The core logic in `content.js` uses `el.outerHTML = replacementString` to replace tags. Since we can control the `replacementString` by exploiting the insecure message listener, we can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript into any page the bot visits. This is a classic DOM-based XSS vulnerability.

### Step 2: Crafting the Three-Stage Exploit

The exploit will be a single HTML page that executes the attack in three sequential stages.

* **Stage 1: Leak the Extension ID.** The page contains a deprecated `<marquee>` tag. A `MutationObserver` is used to watch the DOM. When the extension replaces the tag, the observer captures the newly added `` element and extracts the extension ID from its `src` attribute.

* **Stage 2: Hijack the Replacement String.** With the ID, we create a hidden `iframe` pointing to the extension's `popup.html` page (`chrome-extension://[ID]/popup.html`). Once loaded, we send a `postMessage` to the `iframe` with a `SET` command, overwriting the `replacementString` in `chrome.storage.sync` with our malicious XSS payload.

* **Stage 3: Trigger XSS and Exfiltrate the Flag.** After setting the payload, we redirect the bot to the flag page at `http://localhost:1337`. The extension activates on that page, replacing its `<marquee>` tag with our payload. The payload's JavaScript then executes, fetches the page content again to get the flag, and sends it to our external server.

### Step 3: Overcoming Final Hurdles (CORS and Hosting)

During local testing, two final issues were identified and solved:

1\. **CORS Policy:** The initial payload used `fetch()` to send the flag to our webhook, which was blocked by the browser's CORS policy. The fix was to use a technique that bypasses CORS: creating a new image element and setting its source to our webhook URL with the flag appended as a query parameter (`new Image().src = ...`). Browser image requests are not blocked by CORS in the same way.

2\. **Exploit Hosting:** Simple hosting solutions like `[htmlpreview.github.io](http://htmlpreview.github.io)` were not suitable because they serve content inside a sandboxed `<iframe>`, which restricts critical functions like cross-origin redirection and `iframe` creation. The solution was to use a direct file hosting service. **Netlify Drop** (`<https://app.netlify.com/drop>`) was perfect for this, as it provides a clean, unrestricted public URL for a single HTML file.

### Step 4: Final Exploit and Execution

The following clean, comment-free code was hosted on Netlify.

const extensionUrl = new URL(node.src);  
const extensionId = extensionUrl.hostname;  
obs.disconnect();  
setMaliciousPayload(extensionId);  
return;  
}  
}  
}  
});

observer.observe(document.body, { childList: true, subtree: true });

function setMaliciousPayload(extensionId) {  
const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');  
iframe.src = `chrome-extension://${extensionId}/popup.html`;  
iframe.style.display = "none";  
iframe.onload = () => {  
const payload = `![](https://ctftime.org/x)`;  
iframe.contentWindow.postMessage({ type: "SET", replacementString: payload }, '*');  
setTimeout(() => { window.location.href = "http://localhost:1337"; }, 1500);  
};  
document.body.appendChild(iframe);  
}  
</script>  
</body>

```

This file was hosted on Netlify, providing the final URL for the bot:  
`https://your.app/exp.html`

Submitting this URL to the admin bot successfully triggered the exploit chain.

A few seconds later, the flag arrived at our webhook endpoint.
