# World of Ottercraft 

## Description  
```  
Welcome to the World of Ottercraft, where otters rule the blockchain! In this challenge, you'll dive deep into the blockchain to grab the mythical Otter Stone! Beware of the powerful monsters that will try to block your path! Can you outsmart them and fish out the Otter Stone, or will you just end up swimming in circles?

This challenge is the next one in the Blockchain series, and since I already explained some things about the framework in "The Otter Scrolls", I will get straight into the challenge here.

Now this one has a lot more going on than the previous one, but let's take a look at the provided solve interface too:  
```rust  
module solve::solve {

// [*] Import dependencies  
use challenge::Otter::{Self, OTTER};

public fun solve(  
_board: &mut Otter::QuestBoard,  
_vault: &mut Otter::Vault<OTTER>,  
_player: &mut Otter::Player,  
_ctx: &mut TxContext  
) {  
// Your code here...  
}

}  
```

Alright so: We have a quest board, a vault, a player and a context, and there are a lot of different functions we can call.

noteably:  
\- `enter_tavern` if we have a `player` whose `status` is `RESTING`, which gives us a `TawernTicket` and sets `player.status` to `SHOPPING`  
\- `buy_flag` if we have `player.status` is `SHOPPING` and we have a `TawernTicket`, and adds 537 to `ticket.value`  
\- `buy_sword`, `buy_shield` and `buy_power_of_friendship`, just like `buy_flag`, and they add 140, 20 and 190 to `ticket.total`, as well as 213, 7 and 9000 to `player.power`  
\- `checkout`, needs `vault`, `player`, `context`, `quest_board` and a `TawernTicket`, and all the conditions that need to me met are: `0 < ticket.total <= player.wallet`, and it sets `player.status` to `RESTING`, and marks the flag as purchased, which would complete the challenge, if the `buy_flag` function was called  
\- `find_a_monster`, which can only be called if `player.status` is not `SHOPPING`, `FINISHED`, `RESTING` or `ON_ADVENTURE`, which adds a monster to the `quest_board` with a power and reward, as well as setting `player.status` to `PREPARE_FOR_TROUBLE`  
\- `bring_it_on`, which can only be done if `player.status` is not `SHOPPING`, `FINISHED`, `RESTING`, or `ON_ADVENTURE`, which fights the monster at the provided quest index can only succeed if `player.power > monster.power` and sets `player.status` to `ON_ADVENTURE`, as well as `monster.power` to 0 and `player.power` back down to its standard value 10  
\- `return_home` which requires that `player.status` is not `SHOPPING`, `FINISHED`, `RESTING` or `PREPARE_FOR_TROUBLE` and sets `player.status` to `FINISHED` and sets `quest_to_finish` to the index of the monster that was fought  
\- `get_the_reward`, which can only be done if `player.status` is not `RESTING`, `PREPARE_FOR_TROUBLE` or `ON_ADVENTURE`, and increases `player.wallet` by the reward of the monster at index `quest_to_finish`, and then removes the monster from the list

Now, one would expect the normal gameplay loop to be: Visit the tavern, buy equipment, checkout, add a monster to the questboard, defeat the monster, return home and get the reward.

This would only work once though, since the players power gets reset after every fight, so equipment is consumeable, but unfortunately, the equipment required to defeat a monster is more expensive than the reward the monster gives.

So instead we have to do a little sequence breaking, and we will abuse the fact that the player state is not always checked correctly.

Our only way of generating money, is getting the reward, which doesn't actually check if a monster has been defeated or not, and just gets the top monster from the quest board, and pays out. And even better, we can totally call this function when the player is in a state other than `FINISHED`, namely `SHOPPING`.

So our plan now: get equipped, generate a bunch of monsters for our quest board, defeat one, get the reward, go shopping and get the reward again until there are no monsters left on the board, which should lead to enough money to be able to afford the flag.

There is just a small roadblock: the generated tickets must always be consumed by the `checkout` function, otherwise the transaction is illegal. Luckily, we can always call `checkout` from any state, and so we can make sure to buy a cheap shield while we are shopping, and still make big profits.

Coding all of this out results in this here:  
```rust  
module solve::solve {

// [*] Import dependencies  
use challenge::Otter::{Self, OTTER};

public fun solve(  
_board: &mut Otter::QuestBoard,  
_vault: &mut Otter::Vault<OTTER>,  
_player: &mut Otter::Player,  
_ctx: &mut TxContext  
) {  
let mut friendship_ticket = Otter::enter_tavern(_player);  
Otter::buy_power_of_friendship(_player, &mut friendship_ticket);  
Otter::checkout(friendship_ticket, _player, _ctx, _vault, _board);  
let mut i = 0;  
while (i < 9) {  
Otter::find_a_monster(_board, _player);  
i = i + 1;  
};  
Otter::bring_it_on(_board, _player, 0);  
Otter::return_home(_board, _player);  
Otter::get_the_reward(_vault, _board, _player, _ctx);  
  
i = 0;  
while (i < 8) {  
let mut ticket = Otter::enter_tavern(_player);  
Otter::buy_shield(_player, &mut ticket);  
Otter::get_the_reward(_vault, _board, _player, _ctx);  
Otter::checkout(ticket, _player, _ctx, _vault, _board);  
i = i + 1;  
};  
  
let mut flag_ticket = Otter::enter_tavern(_player);  
Otter::buy_flag(&mut flag_ticket, _player);  
Otter::checkout(flag_ticket, _player, _ctx, _vault, _board);  
}

}  
```

Which gets us the flag:   
`justCTF{Ott3r_uses_expl0it_its_sup3r_eff3ctiv3}`
