## Description

We love our graphics to be portable! If you can abide our rules, we might give you the flag... 

We get THE `challenge` BINARY  
\---

## Recon (yet again)

We start by opening ida and importing the binary!

I recommend when doing reverse sometimes to filter the functions that are related to `main`!   
For example:

![main](main.png)

Lets start looking at main!

We can find this! 

```c  
main_readExactly(*(io_Reader_0 *)v50, *(int *)&v50[16]);  
if ( v5 )  
{  
v6 = 0;  
}  
else  
{  
if ( v4 == main_pngSig.len )  
runtime_memequal();  
else  
v7 = 0;  
v6 = v7 != 0LL;  
}  
v50[69] = v6;  
```

This means that some PNG signature must match  
lets try to connect to the server  
Im just gonna use a test.png photo dosent really matter  
```bash  
$ nc -q 1 [ctf.ac.upt.ro](http://ctf.ac.upt.ro) 9330 < test.png  
Please upload your file (raw):  
Nope!  
```

## Solve

Let's look inside the code to see what kind of png does it want!  
We can fine some interesting stuff like:

the IHDR parsing block:  
```c  
else if ( v26 == 72 && v68[6] == 68LL && v68[7] == 82LL ) // 'IDHR'  
{  
if ( v22 )  
v25 = 0LL; // invalidate if IHDR not first  
...  
v66 = 1;  
if ( *(unsigned int *)&v50[72] == 1337LL && *(unsigned int *)&v50[76] == 1LL && v50[80] == 8LL )  
v39 = v50[68];  
else  
v39 = 0;  
if ( v50[81] != 2LL && v50[81] != 6LL )  
v39 = 0;  
if ( v50[82] || v50[83] || v50[84] )  
v39 = 0;  
}  
```

**If you want more details about IHDR check out this page <https://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Chunks.html**>  
This tells us the IHDR chunk must be the very first one!   
Scrolling down we can find each test!

![idhr](idhr.png)

Which means:  
```bash  
Width = 1337  
Height = 1  
Bit depth = 8  
Color type = 2 (RGB) or 6 (RGBA)  
Compression, filter, interlace = 0  
```

Still in `main.main` we can find this

![ong](png.png)

Which means:  
We must include at least one IDAT.  
We must include an IEND chunk.  
After IEND there can be no trailing bytes.

After searching around we find this calls:   
![tEXt](tEXt.png)

And going in `main.parseTEXTPass` we can clearly see the bytes:

![1](1.png)

readable:  
```c  
if ( v17 == 15 )  
{  
la a1, "6ee494848e978ea"  
li a2, 0Fh  
jal runtime_memequal  
}  
...  
if ( v6 == 17 )  
{  
la a1, "d50bc687e6e14f8f8"  
li a2, 11h  
jal runtime_memequal  
}  
```

So The `tEXt` payload must be:  
```bash  
"6ee494848e978ea" + \x00 + "d50bc687e6e14f8f8"  
```

After this we need to find the raRE chunk!   
  
![rare](raRE.png)

Pressing tab to see the value is:

![2](2.png)

Readable:  
```c  
la a1, "2b6b2c6ba2912d219d"  
li a2, 12h # 18  
```

We must include a custom chunk `raRE` with exactly 18 bytes, and the payload must equal `"2b6b2c6ba2912d219d"`.

And now using the `[solve.py](http://solve.py)` to create the PNG with the constant values we can grab the flag!

```bash  
$ python3 [makepng.py](http://makepng.py)  
built pass.png  
```

```bash  
$ nc -q 1 [ctf.ac.upt.ro](http://ctf.ac.upt.ro) 9330 < pass.png

```

There is our flag!
